This guy should not be on the streets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it such a big deal? He's twisted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What if he did that to Gwen? I just don't see why you have to be the one to take the stand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's ten other women.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want to be the one that stops him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd you get so stubborn? Sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you going to the fires, Daddy? That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">pumpkin.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Daddy's going to the firehouse.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lorraine Lounis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm thinking about a job in '83.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She family? I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just gave her a call and send you over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lorraine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You worked the old cases? How can I help you? Uh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">actually it's my fiance's daughter needs help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's meet me here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's a really nice girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She just has some problems.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do these problems have anything to do with homicide? Her mother was m*rder*d 20 years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She and her father were both haunted by it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rob doesn't talk about it much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gwen is obsessed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And it's making her do crazy things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like? Oh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here she is Gwen! Over here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what good this is gonna do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This detective is going to help us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm Lily Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna tell me about your mom? Her name is Dana Deamer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She got k*lled by Albert Miller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A drainless pervert, she was about to testify against.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He exposed himself to Dana.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A week before his trial, a b*mb went off in her face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She leaved her 16 minutes, then died in our backyard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Miller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">never even got arrested.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't always get them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The first time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He is in jail now for another charge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he's about to be paroled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In three days.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have you been tracking him for a while? I just turned 25.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's how old my mom was when she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never realized until now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just how young that is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that's when you looked him up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ever since then, her behavior has been a little reckless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lorraine! - We have to tell her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's been calling Albert Miller in jail, making threats.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't wanna do it, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He k*lled my mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And if nobody's gonna do anything about that, I will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How much do you remember about the day it happened? Just parts of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was only five.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everybody up? Yes, but Missy has the flu.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So she stays in bed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll be right back to braid your hair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Time to braid everybody's hair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone but poor Missy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then I went out to the back and saw her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wish I would've never have done that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll read your mom's case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I get new direction, I'll talk to parole board, see if they'll hold Miller to give me time, okay? You can do that? I can try but they'll be more receptive if you stop the threats.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gag gone bad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Timmy Sanders needs backup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He always needs backup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, couple of yuppies got jacked by some dirtballs posing as drug dealers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But the yuppies were packing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">semi-automatics.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Fu Manchu.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">runs chinese checkout on the corner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pulls out his pump-action shotgun, makes it a three-way sh**t-out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Sanders got this? - Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you know he needs help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy couldn't solve a crossword puzzle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you going to come out and play with the boys, or what? Can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got a box to see about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Another cold one? Yeah, yeah, tell that to this girl threatening to castrate the doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When are you coming back on the line? Don't know if I am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When did this job come in? '83.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An '83 job can wait, Lilly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, it can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's waited long enough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dana Deamer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A b*mb was left on her back porch inside some kind of box.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She picked it up, it went off in her face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They had a good suspect? - Albert Miller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">High school teacher and chronic sexual deviant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was scheduled to testify against him after flashing her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then Dana conveniently dies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mmmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her daughter's been living with it for the past 20 years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and it shows.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damaged goods? Like it happened yesterday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They couldn't make a case against Miller? Couldn't place him at the scene or connect him to a b*mb.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I hope he's not back teaching high school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, he is in Graterford doing a stretch for indecent exposure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sweet little girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her dad still fireman? Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's our next stop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I don't want to be any trouble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know you've got plenty of new homicides to deal with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We work old ones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Dana's case seemed like it should have been open and shut.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but it just slipped through the cracks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rob's as worried about Gwen as I am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm always worried about Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's not helping herself by threatening Albert Miller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She just She never got over losing Dana.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you? I try to look ahead and not back but Gwen she talks about closure a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're going to see what we can do before the parole hearing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything you can do to keep him locked up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm all for.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a dangerous man, and my headstrong daughter keeps provoking him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did he thr*aten Dana in '83? - He sure did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she still insisted on testifying.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dana was headstong, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was your company that was called to the scene, right? I've responded to a thousand fires.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But when I heard my own address Mom! Mom! Mom! Maria, where is Dana? Mom's hurt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I sat next to her body as long as they would let me, and I remember when I finally got up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they handed me her wedding ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think you've put something away and then it sneaks back sometimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did your company have an arson investigator on the scene? Yeah, Frank Lawson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's still on the job in Cedarbrook.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for cooperating.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you and Gwen can finally get closure here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush, he's got something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah? Oh, yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got something good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">deep in the databases.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your pervert Albert Miller had a secret.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something they didn't get in '83? Well, they didn't have Nexis or Auto-track in '83.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From '78 to '82, Miller worked summers in mines on the Iron Range in Minnesota, working with expl*sives.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If we can match what he learned in those mines with evidence from the scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except physical evidence is nowhere to be found.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need it before the hearing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go to the warehouse myself, but the clerk doesn't know where anything from the '80s went.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think it's time we meet Albert Miller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This crazy tomato keeps calling me up, saying she's going to sh**t me down in the street if I get out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kind of make you regret k*lling her mom? I flashed her mom in Franklin parkway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Flashed a hundred ladies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll any of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You just threatened to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never threatened Dana Deamer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was a fiction.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have CSB disorder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not a violent man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">CSB? Compulsive sexual behavior.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a psychological condition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I shouldn't even be criminalized.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You walked naked through a girl's middle school, Albert.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That shouldn't be criminalized? My life becameunmanageable.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I had wrong urges, but I never blew people up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a high school English teacher.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about the expl*sives you worked with in Minnesota? Hey, I stuck fuses into dynamites and pushed the button.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that was the extent of my job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know how to make a b*mb.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't mention that part of work history to the detectives in '83, did you? That would've been committing su1c1de.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">m*rder is more your style.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look I'm reformed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've made a useful contribution in here training guide dogs for the blind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm going to try and get a job in that vein when I'm out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I deserve parole.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll see about that in two days.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please Don't sink me with that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good luck with the CSB, Albert.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That guy have m*rder in him? - Maybe 20 years ago, he did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I checked my messages, Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't have to leave three voice mails in three hours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I really needed you, Louie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And here I am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm working an old case and the original evidence doesn't seem to be anywhere on planet Earth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I would characterize that as your problem, not mine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's the oldest crime scene fresh evidence was ever discovered at.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lucy, 6000 years old.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone smashed her skull in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I've got a 20-year-old crime scene where I think we can find evidence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That put a bump in your heart rate? Slightly and I can do it in a month.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about tomorrow? I'm booked, Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The vicitim's husband is a fireman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Civil servant like us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Daughter's been suffering over it since she was five years old.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What makes you think there's anything new to be found? See that crawl space? When the back door was blown out, what if debris went under the house? The guys from '83 never looked under the house? Why would they when there was so much debris in plain sight? That's 20 years of weather, wind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But it was all protected by a house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not impossible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The key areas where evidence may have been missed and possible preserved.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">are here, here, here and in there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You going in that crawl space, Louie? - You bet I am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush, Maria Sanchez is out front.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The next door neighborhood that was first on the scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got her interview from '83.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I asked her to walk us through it inside.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holy mama.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Such a shame, this place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No one wanted to buy it after what happened.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is Albert Miller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You never saw this guy in the neighborhood, right, Maria? I should've said I saw him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lied, you mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Help justice get done.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you didn't see him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Technically, no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's stick to the technical.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell us what happened.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was 8 o'clock.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was letting the dog out, when I hear the expl*si*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom? Mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This way, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom! Mom! Mommy, mommy! Mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't mention the telephone in '83.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess they didn't ask.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're sure about hanging it up, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because I remember thinking "What if her husband tries to call?" Okay, Thanks, Maria.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think Dana got a prompting phone call? It's possible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Phone records. 20-year-old phone records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bell Atlantic, Bell of Pennsylvania, AT&amp;T;, Verizon Four companies ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Should I get an emergency subpoena? - Naked aggression would be faster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll call Vera.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective? I'm Frank Lawson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You called me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh - The fire marshal? - Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think the guy under the house wants you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember what you found on this scene in '83? We discovered pretty quickly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was an expl*sive device.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looked for an accelerant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was there one? - No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was just gunpowder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So any old hobbyist could have made that b*mb.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't real sophisticated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush! I got something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're kidding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I am not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll just stick around in case you need me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">/ Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you see it? I see something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charred cardboard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remnants of the box the b*mb was in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will they have powder residue? - It could.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could have fingerprints.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a gold mine under there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm going to be analyzing all night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush Rob Deamer's here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wonder how he heard about this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Firemen's grapevine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought Rob and Lawson were friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a thing of the past.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How you doing? I wish you would have told me this was going on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't know if you'd want to be here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was my wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I should be here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just trying to keep Miller locked up, Rob.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well what? Why would you What are you looking for? Remnants of the expl*si*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">- 20 years later? I'm an optimist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I see you contacted Frank Lawson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, Is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">uh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">is there some kind of problem between you two? It has nothing to do with this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just I think he had a thing for my wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I perfomed the miracle of loaves and fishes getting these telephone records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd you do it, Vera? I had to p*stol whip a lady.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She probably deserved it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So? It's all for naught.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's no record of any the numbers associated to Albert Miller calling the Deamer house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even if Albert did call Dana that morning, why would she go get a package he'd left for her? He was threatening her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is exciting, Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your pieces of cardboard? No prints.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No partials.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm waiting for the exciting part.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Watch as I put the pieces together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They have teeny bits of color in the uncharred areas.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And when you fit them together like a jigsaw puzzle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, look, look, look, look.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was laundry detergent.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gleen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Isn't it kind of brilliant? It is, actually.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because look at the kitchen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On that shelf.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same detergent.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was her brand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe no one made a case against Albert because he didn't do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just cleared the pervert? - Not necessarily.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But how would some random flasher know what kind of detergent she used? It'd have to be someone who had been in that house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone closer to home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone she trusted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not going to be able to stop this, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You said.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you found evidence at the house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But it didn't support Albert as the k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you got our hopes up for nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This doesn't mean I'm dropping your mom's case, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I laid off this guy because you said you could help us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I pray for your family.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wish you peace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Honestly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pray for yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What? He k*lled my mom and now he's walking out the door.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Baby,listen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There may not be justice for mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You just have to accept that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There must be something you can do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a lot I can do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We've heard that before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't make guarantees but I'm still on this job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, why should I trust you, huh? - I don't even know you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, you don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because if you did, you'd know I was just getting started.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush, come here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've gone through these logs three times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There is no record of an incoming call that morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you see this number? Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">/ Nine calls to the Deamer house the month before Dana dies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And guess who the number traces back to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Frank Lawson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The fire marshal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And expl*sives expert.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He worked with Rob Deamer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he was calling him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm? But I went through the duty roster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In '83? They got them going back to '68.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lawson was only calling when Rob Deamer was at work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He knew he wouldn't be home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not so bad, Vera.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I am good for something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did you transfer out here? Change of pace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And a 40 minute commute? I like this house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you stop liking the other one? I ask because, uh, there seemed to be some tension between you and Rob the other day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We drifted apart, after Dana.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were you close with her? We got along.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got along like, "Hey, how you doing?" or got along like, uh, nine secret phone calls in a month.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That marriage was falling apart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were Rob's friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's his wife end up crying on your shoulder? Rob wasn't a great husband and his mom was pretty hard on Dana.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She'd tell me things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was someone she could talk to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were you in love with her, Frank? Rob's mother was here all morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sitting there with her journal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Watching, writing She went to the bathroom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I took a look.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't help it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And? "Expired apple juice in refrigerator" It was punishment for last night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm in trouble because I went out without wearing my wedding ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd you do that? I just take it off sometimes, to garden or whatever.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and just forget to put it back on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But it sets Rob off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe there's surveillance camera in it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you tell? Could there be a tiny microphone? I was navy intelligence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let me see.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The day she died, all he could think about was that ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rob? I think they were still working on her you know, she wasn't quite dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And his daughter's terrified but he's running around looking for the ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's the ring? where's the ring?" Like he had to have it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you pointing to him as planting the b*mb? No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Absolutely not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The guy she was going to testify against did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's the old story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rob and I were both at work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was upstairs, I was downstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were there phones upstairs? No, only where I was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Rob didn't call Dana that day? - I would remember that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never left the building? I would remember.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you could have called Dana.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or left building.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could have.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were an expl*sives expert and half in love with her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I loved her, why would I k*ll her? It's happened before in human history.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lawson's interview goes either way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, she's unhappy, wants to leave Rob.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He knows it, he blows her up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or Lawson was in love with her, thinks she's going to leave her husband and she laughs in his face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he knows about bombs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He used to hang out in the kitchen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'd know her detergent brand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wanted into her pants.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He probably did her laundry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got to keep looking at both of them, guys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil, I gotta go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bye.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't have to solve this case tonight, you know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This job is languishing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need to pump some life into it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those are bank records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm going back to the basics, following the money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Love or money are always your best bets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we already checked love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't stay, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You already said that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, you did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bye.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like you're in for a fun night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">March 10, 1979 $200.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">April 10, $200 a*t*matic deduction.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Payable to the court.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By the order of the court shall be deducted remitted monthly Robert Deamer to to Adrian Martin.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">/ Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Spousal support.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did we know about Adrian Martin? Lorraine talks about Dana being his first wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She never mentioned it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A second one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a disaster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rob was so temperamental, when you're young and dumb that's romantic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When you're older and married? You get tired of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's watching, judging everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were you afraid of him? Sometimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was possessive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like how? He'd always hold my hand in public, but never in private.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like the whole point of it was to show others I was his.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How did it finally end? My dad talked some sense into me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got me to pack up and go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Rob wouldn't let me leave the premises, till I gave him my ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was big with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Getting the ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I actually had high hopes for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why do women always have high hopes for guys who want to k*ll them? Las.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's another one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Another what? - Wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was only two years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, he'd be off my radar totally if I wasn't traumatized by him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was he possessive, Pauline? Possessive, controlling.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a fiasco.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did he make a big deal about your wedding ring? How do you know that? One night, I had gone out to dinner with an old boyfriend from high school who was visiting in, and I came home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and he said "Take off your wedding ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">" I said, "Why?" He said, "Just take it off, and you'll find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">" So I took it off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He went down to the basement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had this workshop there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he crushed the ring in a vice, and then he put it on my pillow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh / I figured that was my cue to leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of workshop did he have? Uh, he made amateur rockets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was his hobby.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lilly? Your pervert pal's on the line.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, Albert Miller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Apparently, Gwen tracked him down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Excuse me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just paid $1,200.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for this piece of crap car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Albert, Albert.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't pay to have these windows fixed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Albert.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't want to send this girl to jail.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She grew up without a mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's troubled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I don't think you did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, you're flawed but you're not heartless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't want Gwen arrested.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why you called me when you didn't have to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Being in the system ain't fun.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But that's where she's gonna end up, if she's so damn compulsive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know I won't press charges.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just get that loony girl out of my life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This isn't a real constructive way to handle things, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He k*lled my mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't care about constructive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think he did k*ll your mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of course he did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The b*mb that k*lled your mother was in a box of Gleen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So? The person who k*lled her would've known what kind of detergent she used.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That wouldn't be Albert.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone placed a phone call to your mom that morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you know that? For some reason, there's no record of that phone call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I don't know how to explain that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted your help getting him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Punishing him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Albert wasn't that guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's evidence that points another way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What way? Towards your father.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's crazy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Put it together in your head, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You dad's hobby was making rockets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your mom and dad fought.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had two other wives.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One other wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There were two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One before and one after your mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know why that matters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It reveals a pattern of your dad's behavior that wasn't evident in 1983.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I don't understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had controlling relationships with both those women.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you know? And he was fixated on getting their wedding rings when it was all over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just like he was with your mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My dad was devastated about losing my mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was hunting for her wedding ring, while she lay dying.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maria was holding your hand, not him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're going to go too far one of these days.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need to speak to Lorraine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, we're leaving.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's important.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you in charge of who she talks to? Lorraine, stay in the car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Listen, I have tried to be polite to you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but maybe, you don't get polite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I get deception from you, Rob.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And agression.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, our family doesn't need you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you understand? Gwen's going to get though this, me and Lorraine are going to get married.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we're all going to try to get a little piece of happiness.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that new, Lorraine? - Just this morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're leaving now, and we don't want to see you again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any chance of a search warrant? For a 22 year old hobby? - Judge Fisk really likes you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not that much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What you doing? I was looking around my dad's workshop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah Thinking about my mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have you ever seen a pool of blood? Not just blood but a whole pool of it? Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you can't forget it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I'm going to do this, I'm going to have to k*ll myself after.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do what, Gwen? Turn in my father.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you have evidence against him? I know how you make a call without leaving a record of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about England? Do you know how they talk in England, Gwendolyn? No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Ooh, I want Paris.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll look up the code.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you say, "Oui, madame?" Wee His dad was a telephone repairman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How could he do that? I've seen it a hundred times and I still don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know where he is now? The Poconos with Lorraine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're eloping.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't have enough to arrest him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He doesn't have to know that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ready, Gwen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hope you haven't taken the vows yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's going on? We haven't met.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Vera.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We found Dana's k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And? - I'm sorry, Lorraine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know you thought you'd found your happiness with Rob.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he's not the one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why not? Rob doesn't have luck with marriage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why don't you go sit with Gwen? She'll tell you the details.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You stay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd you do to my daughter? Found her mom's k*ller, like she asked me to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Brainwashed her is more like it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, I don't know how to control people like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are they talking about me? - Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I were a betting man, I'd say you, Rob.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and your rocket bombs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gwen doesn't believe that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gwen told us how you made the untraceable call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, excuse me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need to go deprogram my daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pisses you off, doesn't it? Not knowing what they're saying what they're doing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't pretend that you know me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, I do know you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know you had two other wives you pushed around, Pauline, Adrian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about them? - They were the lucky ones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They got out in time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They probably didn't talk back like Dana did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably weren't so,uh, headstrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know about that, don't you? I do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got all these opinions, ideas that might not be the same as yours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, I'm just the kind of girl that pisses you off, Rob.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just the kind of girl you'd like to blow to bits.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you the kind of girl that would flirt with your husband's friends? I might.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">/ Mouth off to his mother, insult her to her face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds about right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be so damn stubborn that every single conversation turns into World w*r III.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And on top of that, I'd be teaching my daughter to be just as big of a pain in the ass as I am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you put up with this? - Tough lady.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, maybe you'd deserve a lesson, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And it was so handy having a guy like Albert Miller to set up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hello? I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We fight too much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Listen, I got you something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You did? Just something I noticed you needed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's out on the back porch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's sweet of you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go take a look.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll wait.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
