   <line type="dialogue">Mitchell Bayes served as
organist and musical director</line>
   <line type="dialogue">of St. Anthony's Episcopal
church in Roxborough..."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's the son.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">She was talking about him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was m*rder*d?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's been going back there a lot lately.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doctor says it's something about
older memories becoming more present.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's Alzheimer's?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Might wanna get her
one of those bracelets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ordered one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was carrying these.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We ever get the guy?</line>

   <line type="dialogue">Come on. Let's go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's okay. It's okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's an ' job doing next to a ' ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Civillian workers going the extra mile.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how'd this guy die?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stabbed by a hooker was the theory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here it is. Bayes, ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are we looking at this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The lady was so distressed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just wondered why
we didn't bring the job in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch Bayes, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stabbed times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wallet was gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Presumed robbery-homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never found a w*apon?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, they never even
named a good suspect.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bump in the night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's take this upstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So is this a regular thing
now? Working cold jobs?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I am. You can stay
on the line if you want.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess cold cases aren't less
important than new ones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're more important.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're been waiting longer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any limits on how far back we can look?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No limits.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's some problems
with this job, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unsolved is always a problem, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The ME reports and the
body chart don't match.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus the inventory of
the clothes in the van.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pants, underwear, shirt,
shoes... but no socks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was February.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't go anywhere
in February without socks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe they were inventoried wrong?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whatever happened,
this case was a rush job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The assigned chalked it up
to a solicitation gone bad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pretty much left it at that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is a nice lady, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And her memory's going fast. If
we're ever going to look at this again...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We should do it now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's the assigned?
- Gil Sherman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This was a typical job
during the crack era.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy comes 'round looking
for some company,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ends up robbed and k*lled by the girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd you think it was a hooker?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ever been to Kensington
Avenue, darling?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's hookerland.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I grew up in Kensington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what was he doing there,
seeing the sights?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't have this back wound
marked on your bodychart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So I missed it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever miss a wound?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did forensics show you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forensics were screwed. Rained
like a son of a b*tch that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whole scene got soaked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was in the back of a van.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They should have had some
evidence to work with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Partial prints on vials.
Inconclusive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So there were no suspects at all?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plenty of suspects.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whores, dealers, homeless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing stuck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that was it. End of case?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, Rush... these murders
were a dime a dozen that year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">crackheads thought nothing
of icing a guy for bucks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Next night the same job all over again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I felt for this family though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were decent people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had to tell 'em on a Sunday morning....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We found him in his vehicle</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just off of Kensington Avenue.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't understand why he'd be there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a lot of activity in that area.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of activity?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch wouldn't be
there. / I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, Mitch didn't use
dr*gs, or prostitues.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We are churchgoing people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He didn't use.... prostitutes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bayes was a hypocrite church type.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whoring Saturday night,
asking forgiveness on Sunday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Son's meeting us here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he's already here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I'm not sure
where they went exactly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I..Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll... I'll tell them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When they.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, I'll make sure
I tell them. / Hello.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're home now...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, Charlotte.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">T-Tina.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, no, Lily.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remeber we talked about Mitch?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitchell Bayes served as
organist and musical director</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at St. Anthony's Episcopal
church in Roxborough..."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh. You're here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Mom let you in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The door was open, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was she trying to leave?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, she was just talking to herself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She has good days and bad days.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't have a church funeral
for Mitch... / Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why is she talking about Dad?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I brought him up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking at his case again, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll do what I can to help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was only , you know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know if your dad
had any enemies?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe someone
from work, or church?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, he worked at Drexel Insurance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think it was pretty mundane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At church all he had was friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were you surprised to hear he
was found on Kensington Avenue?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were all shocked by that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Including your Mom?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think it was the humiliation of her life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could we try to talk to
her about that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It'll be tricky. She kind
of goes in and out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom. Mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're gonna talk about dad, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About the night he died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay...Mitch...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He died, Mitch died...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember we had dinner as a family?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I was going to a school formal,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I was worried
because I couldn't dance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll teach you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone can dance...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cheers.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">I don't remember a phone call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your mom does.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe she's adding
that detail in her mind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Embellishing, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To be honest, I'm still learning
about what's happening to her.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">It's all wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch Bayes didn't hang out here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta redeem this guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Henry Walsh, his name's on
one of these porn rags</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that was found in the van.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's not in your file.
Do you know who he is?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Great, Sherman. Got to run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A simple yes or no
don't work for Sherman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I take it he didn't auto-track Walsh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably too busy will
all the crack going on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys again?
- You were right, Tina.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your dad didn't go with
a hooker that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think someone drove him
to that ally after they k*lled him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That cop told us...
- That cop was wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew my dad was too good for that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were close, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking for the truth here, Tina.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you help us and talk to us?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Start with the night he died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was there a phone call?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice families don't talk
about these things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina, what things?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was the phone call?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know who it was?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had an idea.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know where you're going now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm going home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, you're not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you talking about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't go.
Call her and say no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">T-Tina!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go on in the house. I can
see Cindy's waiting for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're always talking about
what's a sin and all that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is a sin, dad,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what you're doing with Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You get out of this car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was our last conversation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who was Judy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just heard him talking
on the phone to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After he died, I thought</line>
   <line type="dialogue">maybe it was a prost*tute that....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you think your mom
knew about Judy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't know that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you should go
with us to see your mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ask her about this woman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why don't you ask her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your probably would have a better chance
of getting through with her condition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What condition?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your brother says it's Alzheimer's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're probably going to have
to help the conversation along.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't worry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The door's open again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, God...Mom.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">All these locks...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what's that about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wish you would comb your hair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She knows me now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can we talk to her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom, we want to talk about Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy and Dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">never cared for Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never cared for Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who was she, Charlotte?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How did you know her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy Enright.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never cared for Judy Enright.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlotte, it's okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's going on here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never cared for Judy...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you doing here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just... I thought I'd come...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>

   <line type="dialogue">We asked her to come.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'm asking you to leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They believed me about dad, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Congratulations.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I really do want to help you,
but I'm not coming back here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She always, always has the solos.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She always...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She always has the solos.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You shouldn't have come here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Strangers upset her.
- We thought with Tina....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You thought wrong.
- The most talented singer...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was talking to us about Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That name mean anything to you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Look, you should know my
sister has emotional problems.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's been hospitalized a few times</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and sometimes she says things
that aren't necessarily true.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You should know your front
door was open again, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina says your dad was
close to this woman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I told you that she
has mental problems.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Excuse me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something going on
with this family, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The brother and sister
hate each other.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She says they've been oil and
water ever since dad died..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says it's because she's crazy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus that door upstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you, uh, trust this Tina?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She seems more sad than crazy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was hospitalized
twice for depression,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but that doesn't make her a liar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, follow her leads,
see where it takes you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where do you find Judy Enlight?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She works at St. Anthony's
Church in Roxborough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You better wash up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Poor Mitch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was such a disgrace....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">how he ended up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The flesh is weak.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, it is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How well did you know Mitch?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, the congregation
here is very tightknit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus, him on the organ
and you singing solos...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you see Mitch the night he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unless we had a rehearsal,
I don't see how...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy, I have phone records
that show me two calls</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to the Bayes' home that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I suppose you already know, then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was weak, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So did you meet Mitch
the night he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just for a few minutes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, why don't you park?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't do it anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina knows.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't my daughter
being ashamed of me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch, come on, honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll talk about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta stop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's my daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that's the last
I saw of Mitch Bayes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you sure you didn't
follow him, Judy,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in your anger at him,
for breaking it off like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you called Mitch again later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There were two calls from
your house that night, Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't call again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could your husband have called him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'd have no rason, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unless he suspected you two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So did Lassing embarrass you in church?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, he behaved. And we
met Mitch's girlfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah?
She's a suspect?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her alibi's good, but there
was a jealous husband.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera and Jeffries are
checking him out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch's clothes from
the van... no socks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is this criminalist screwing up,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">or were they never
there in the first place?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You might want to ask
your pal Sherman over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">People steal stuff off the
dead bodies all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">People steal Timberlands,
leather jackets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They don't steal a guy's
socks and nothing else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fine. You know best, apparently.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sherman, it's a simple question.
Were the socks at the scene or not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you sure?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm pretty sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're known as a
good detective, Sherman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They say you're the best in Fugitives.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that what they say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what was going on in that
you were doing work like a bum?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing that ain't fixed now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to mid ' ....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a drunk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean bombed full-time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So probably I did some damage,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">being sloppy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just.... wasn't in my head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know that, uh, name you
wanted followed up, Henry Walsh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The guy whose porn rags
were found in the van?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you auto-track him yet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, not yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good. 'Cause I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Figured I'd save you some time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's see, he had a carpet
business in Germantown.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He died three years ago,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I got an address
on the son, Tom Walsh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if that'll help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It would.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know who my dad knew or didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pretty strange how his porn rags</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ended up in a van with a dead man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What am I supposed to do about that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about giving it more
than seconds of thought?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bayes... I knew a Ryan
Bayes in high school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There you go, Tom.
Were you good friends?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We played a lot of Dungeons
and Dragons together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just nerds, you know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nerds who looked
at dad's porn together?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I probably took some
magazines there sometimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys ever take
it to another level,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">like, uh, going to hookers?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do we really got to go into this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've heard so much worse, Tom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess we cruised for
prost*tute once in a while,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just look at them. We'd be terrified
if they actually talked to us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where'd you do that cruising?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kensington Avenue.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You see, Tom,
that's helpful to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Embarrasing to you,
but helpful to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ring, ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll get it, Mom. / Ringing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now is not a good time.
- We had to talk, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not now. / It's very important.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom, go back to the living room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone's here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone's here.
- Did you hear me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go back to the living room.
- Tea, tea, tea.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan, hey, let's you
and me sit down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on. You need a minute of
peace. Las will sit with your mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, take a break.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Isn't there someone
that can help you out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A girlfriend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't have time for that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We guess your mom's kind
of your girlfriend, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She takes a lot of my time,
if that's what you mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I take care of my mom, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She sick in a different
kind of way, but, uh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it makes me half crazy sometimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doesn't feel natural.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's role reversal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I mean, Mom's
supposed to take care of you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what you're
used to. / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did she take good care of you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She let you meet girls?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or did she keep you in</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so you had to look elsewhere
for those interests?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess I mean these.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those aren't mine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Technically they belong
to your friend Tom Walsh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you remember him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-uh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No? He's the guy you used to
cruise Kensington Avenue with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't wanna talk about this anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thing is, I need explanations
for all these lies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because it looks bad that you lied</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy Enright that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that you lied to me just now</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan. / I want you to leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And it really looks bad that you were</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so familiar with the strip
where your dad was dumped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got questions that need
answers here, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And without good answers,
you're my number-one suspect.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My mom and I are not
talking to you anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You speak for your mom?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I do.
And you know what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We want you to drop my dad's case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When I'm so close to
the truth? Not a chance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that was one hot trail
you set us down, Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You met Enright?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You call that guy a suspect?
He's a -pound invalid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's been in a wheelchair
since the Great Flood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No chance he stabbed
anybody in the last century.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, but was he our
second called that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Called Mitch to give him
a piece of his mind</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Talked to the boy instead. / Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I mean, he probably
traumatized that kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Must have told him times</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what a cheating sinner
his old man was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gives Mama's boy his motive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">thanks for coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you find out anything?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Listen, Tina....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think we can put Ryan
at the m*rder scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is how you help me...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your dad wasn't scumbag after all,
but your brother's a m*rder*r?"</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We used to be really close,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">me and my brother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you think you could
help us one more time?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you do it for your dad?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A...a dance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We really have to go
to church tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was a...sleep...
sleep... sleepover....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and a dance,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and that.... that's where
the kid's were going...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kids were going...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">sleepover...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That-that was a big... dance...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know that part, Charolette.
I'm talking about later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I-I-I... I danced,
I danced with Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After the dancing, much later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Ryan fight with Mitch?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Poor Mitch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Poor, poor, poor, poor Mitch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After the dancing, did Ryan
do something to him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch...Mitch..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charolette.
- Mitch, Mitch base...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch took-took you...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch took you..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch took you..to..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you s... your sleepover... Mitch...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He took me to the sleepover?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitch took you,
Mitch took you...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tin-Tina?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina... / It's okay to tell me, Mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did Ryan do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom.. What happened?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clothes...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clothes? Dad's clothes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ge-Get thos.... get those...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">get tho... get those...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get that!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Put it in! put it in!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, put the clothes... I'll</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll fo...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll follow..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll follow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wait!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get that! Get that!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get that!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get that over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">over there!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get that over there!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get those vials!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, hurry!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Put the...put them in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes! Hurry!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hurry!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, Charlotte.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've totally disrupetd my family.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, that was you, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and your mom, years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We heard all about you staging the scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When you weren't there to charperone,
your mom gave us details.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You took advantage of
a sick, old woman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you forgot the socks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice touch with the crack vials,
though... real respectful to dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I respected my dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really? / I respected
my mom, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was I supposed to do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You trying to blame Mom?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom who treated you
like you walked on water?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never asked fot that.
I didn't want to be her pet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She chose me.
I couldn't shake her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like you can't shake her now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You dreamed of being an adult, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Finally escaping her?
- But then Mom got sick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And now you're trapped again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have no idea
how much she needs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know, Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why you leave
the front door open.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe she'll wander away for good,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then you'll be free.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love my mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you're angry at her
for what she made you do:</line>
   <line type="dialogue">commiting m*rder in her name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't do that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Ryan, you're
a classic mama's boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What better way to protect your mom</line>
   <line type="dialogue">than to k*ll the guy
who's done her wrong?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My mom didn't need
protecting from anyone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that supposed to mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You only know her
as this feeble woman</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who gets confused and scared,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you probably feel bad for her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you didn't see her in her prime...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when she terrorized us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We weren't supposed to talk about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice family keeping up appearances.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She would b*tch me
and Tina out all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When it got really bad...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when she was good
and drunk and crazy...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she would attack my dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hit him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He never hit her back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He would just take it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and get away as soon as possible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that why he had all those
locks on his bedroom door?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He couldn't sleep if he
didn't lock himself in at night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's how scared he was of her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And still he stood up
for me that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Knowing what she could do to him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are you home, Ryan?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why aren't you at the dance?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom didn't want me to go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had an interesting call tonight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had a date, Charlotte.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, apparently,
you both had dates.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right, get your jacket. I'll
take you to the dance myself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, he's staying with me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, he's years old, Charlotte.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He doesn't want to sit home on
a Saturday night with his mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, he does!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, he does.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unlike you, who would rather
be sneaking around with Judy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't do this in front of Ryan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan? Ryan took the call!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This between you and me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I'm going to take
him over to the dance</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and when I come back,
we can talk about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's staying with me!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He loves me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He loves me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you, Ryan?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I want to go to the dance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The both of you teaming up against me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan, get your jacket now.
- Wha... Ryan....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not going to talk to you
when you're like this, Charlott.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you understand that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now I'm going to go upstairs and
I'm going to get some dry clothes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitchell... Mitchell!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mi...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitchell!
- Mom,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mitchell! No!
- mom....</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judy Enright is cheap Christmas trash!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's a disgrace and you're a
disgrace to good churchgoing people!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do not shut me out!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't ....you...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you shut me out! / Mom!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do not shut me out!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You will not disgrace me!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you shut me out!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You will not disgrace me!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ryan...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get the van.</line>
