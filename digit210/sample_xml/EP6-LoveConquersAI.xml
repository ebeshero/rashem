   <line type="dialogue">I chose it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three blows to the head</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that would have k*lled her
even if she hadn't been shot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Passion crime.
Someone she knew.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Al Clarkson was her boyfriend,
convicted in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Commonwealth must've had a case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lots of testimony he had a temper.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His gold chain was found
at the scene. / Better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tracks matched the tires on his Nova.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Goodrich TA Radial or
Uniroyal Tiger Paw?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uniroyal. How'd you know that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a popular tire upgrade
on a muscle car like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know a lot about cars?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So this Will Harrell that saw
Ricky cleaning blood out of his car...?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of ride he have?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Trans AM.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could have easily had
those same tires.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So it could have been
his car at the scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right. This snitch's story starts to
gets some credibility.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus a head injury means
a lot of blood,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">found near Paige's body.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So she did most of her
bleeding somewhere else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like inside a car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So why do you like old jobs?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't like the action?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't like b*stards
getting away with m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will Harrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember a guy
named Rick Stockvis,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">used to work here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a name I'd rather forget.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy was a thief.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was lifting our tools,
hocking'em.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're checking a story he told us</line>
   <line type="dialogue">your Trans AM, June , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's pretty specific.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was the same night
a girl named Paige Pratt died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, that didn't happen.
- Did you know Paige?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. / Friend of the family, church?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just said that I didn't know her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You sold that car pretty soon
after her death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">According to VIN records,
it was just six days later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted the new ZX.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of tires were
you sporting, Will?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Factory install or upgrade?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't recall.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's what records are for.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mind if we sit in your office,
look through your paperwork?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, I do.
I'm very busy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will got pretty hinky
near the end there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Make any connect
between him and Paige?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Went to different high schools.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That age, high school's
your whole world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still looking for her parents.
They're not at their old address.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You Valens? / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will Jeffries. Congratulations.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks. It's great being here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jeffries and Vera are a matching set.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone named Roxy
called for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah? Good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Twice. Says she'll try you back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. She don't got a phone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys get a job?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Confession at the scene.
Total duck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna track
this old Trans AM for us?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See if it's still on the street somewhere?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure thing. Lil, you might
wanna go see Al Clarkson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get his view of the world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, it'd be good to find
the second owner on it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whoever bought it from Harrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.
We'll do that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You could learn something
from this guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I bought that Trans AM in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I got a car habit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mercedes taste on a Mazda salary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, did you break the bank
on that TA?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, that was a steal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dumb kid didn't know what it was worth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I sold it for twice what I paid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd he sell it so cheap?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't ask.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A good deal falls in your lap,
you take it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you remember anything
about the kid you bought it from?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, just that he kept
the car up pretty good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seemed to love it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but still, he was selling.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, my boss is
giving me the evil eye.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mind if we finish our coffee?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, live it up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Will worked at an auto shop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He never heard
about Blue Book value?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Motivated seller maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">West Detectives was all
about the volume.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Every night it's hoppin'.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're out there running
your whole shift.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why I'm saying,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just don't know if cold cases
is gonna be my thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I just don't know
if you have a choice, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you want with me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looking into your case again, Al.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lock him up and throw away
the key." That was my case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, we're looking at it again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll Paige.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got railroaded because I was
hanging with a high school girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those guys are a little creepy, Al.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a late bloomer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I see Rudy Tanner was your lawyer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Strip mall hack.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of them guys in bad clothes,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">dropping his folders
all over the place?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's him. / I didn't know
how to find someone good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you explain your gold
chainbeing at the crime scene, Al?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paige was wearing it.
- She wear it a lot?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When we were getting along.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot of people say you had
a real temper with her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She ran wild on me.
I loved her, so it hurt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jealousy ain't against the law.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How come you weren't
with her that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was supposed to be grounded,
but she must've snuck out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Energetic girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, she was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My guess is she must've
met some guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She had someone
on her mind around that time...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What am I missing, Paige?
You're here to run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why you gotta wear
purple eye shadow?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can race and look good. / Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which one is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm tired of the third degree, Al.
- And I'm tired of being your fool.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you should just leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll get my own ride home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So which one was he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never found out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think it could have been this guy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will Harrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, I never saw him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, thanks for your time, Al.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Go pound sand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can just take my car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't worry, kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll get it back to you
when we're done.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a dance Friday night.
Will I have it back by then?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll do our best.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, 'cause I just bought this.
I've only had it for, like, two weeks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First car, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Friday, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hope he's got insurance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, he don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Upholstery could've been
shampooed times,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we're still gonna know
if blood was shed in there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Figure out a Will and Paige connect?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was an athlete at Crespi.
He was a loser at Jefferson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No activities in common.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So maybe Willy's hanging
around the wawa one night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">looking for a party...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. He's got the car going for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paige needs a ride.
- He's a little mole.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doesn't do good with girls.
Makes a play for her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She brushes him off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will breaks her head open.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is the cool part.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hit the light.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He knew her somehow.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">I'm not making it up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the night that girl was m*rder*d,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was at Raiders of the Lost Ark.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You recall that now, too, huh?</line>

   <line type="dialogue">I still have the ticket stub to prove it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have the stub from years ago?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Some good luck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's my favorite movies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You keep stuff like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you do realize
that we have the science</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to tell us the difference between
dog and human blood, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have the ticket stub.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">Old friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, Will, we'll check out that story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have the stub.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what happened

   <line type="dialogue">He wasn't... weak.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi. Bennett Cahill.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Valens,
Homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's it about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy named Will Harrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You went to high school together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could probably place him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right, that guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd he do?
- We don't know yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will says you and him
were best friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">More like acquaintances.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says you went to Raiders
of the Lost Ark</line>
   <line type="dialogue">June , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I doubt it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I probably was with Jane,
but, uh, Will...?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Willy kind of an outcast type?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You could say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had this room at his dad's shop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a no-parents zone, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So a lot of us would hang out there,
drink beer, whatever.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd he do with the ladies?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't recall any big scores.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ever mention a girl named Paige?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. But we didn't talk a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After he freaked me out one night,
I stopped going over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd he do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He showed me a g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Called it a b*tch k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. That's when I stopped
going over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will seem like he could get
frustrated enough to hurt a girl?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I really don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh... I hope not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will was a B-list kid
with A-list aspirations.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hottie like Paige would
have blown him off for sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He meets her, gets the snub,
it's the last straw.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pulls out his b*tch k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you ever find Paige's parents?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm. Moved to Atlanta in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aren't returning phone calls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They already got some in jail.
Why relieve the nightmare?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">DA's office is gonna hate this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Kite's already called
a hundred times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who't Kite?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Assistant D.A. Ivy League jerk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Criminalistics just called.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was Paige's blood in the Trans AM.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can't do this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure we can.
Read the search warrant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm telling you I hit a dog.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that dog had Paige Pratt's DNA.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look. Look.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look at the date.

   <line type="dialogue">Found the b*tch k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've never seen that before in my life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My money says this is
the g*n k*lled Paige.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Party's over, Will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was with Bennett and
Jane that night!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, we talked to Bennett.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He didn't back your story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your "best friend"
barely remembered you, Willy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He said you were a nobody in hight school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A hanger-on who got used
by the popular kids</line>
   <line type="dialogue">cause you gave them a place to party.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He didn't say that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He said he wouldn't be seen
at the movies with you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or anywhere else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, then...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then screw him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna know the truth?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For a change, you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were supposed to go
to the movies that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he asked me to borrow
my car at first.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where the hell have you been?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was a problem.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that... is that blood?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I, uh, I hit a dog.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and Jane?
- No, it was just me, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tried to save it.
I took it to the vet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It bled all over the seats.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You should have called me.
- Yeah...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, upholstery's gonna
need to be cleaned out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we went to Raiders, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't want my mom
knowing about the dog.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure. / Thanks, pal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dumb-a*s story, Willy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's true. / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I loaned Bennett my car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He...He must have k*lled that girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And...and then put the g*n in the ceiling.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then why'd you cover for him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me and Bennett had
a deal not to talk about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I...I thought we were friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, are we gonna do this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just a sec.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You owe me a call, Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was getting to that today.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a difference between
cold cases and closed cases.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you get my meaning?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You agreed to the deal with
that snitch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No one mentioned his information
was on a case we already won.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, then, we should just ignore
the DNA and ballistics, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Am I supposed to go to my boss
and say,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry, you screwed the pooch
on this one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're just gonna star over."?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And innocent man's
been sitting in jail</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for years because of your boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why don't you tell him that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't spring Al Clarkson
untill you arrest Harrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm holding him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want him arrested.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want to give it a day. / No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, then, well...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will's locked up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's that charmer?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ADA Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's above cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't above checking you out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you had your guy, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna check out Will's story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go through it all again,
this time with Bennett in mind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't matter that
everything points to Will?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Al Clarkson got screwed
'cause the prosecutors</line>
   <line type="dialogue">didn't look at all the angles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not doing that to Will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, you looking for
a Bennett-Paige connect?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. / Well...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here. Bennett was
the captain of his track team.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paige ran track for her school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They could have met that way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Al thought she was flirting with
someone at a track meet, remember?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now something's cooking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just a month before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We going back to the doc?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, let's go to the girlfriend
he was supposedly with that night</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys keep reading.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then we'll wash your car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have some questions
about Bennett Cahill.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did something happen to him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah. Alive and kicking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was your high school
boyfriend, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All four years.
- Pretty serious?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Very. But, uh, then we wentto
different colleges, lost touch...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Either of you date anyone else
in high school?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. No, we were together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So there wasn't a girl named
Paige Pratt in your lives?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She went to Crespi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ran track, like Bennett.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know who you're talking about,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">because of what happened to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But we didn't know her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and Bennett knew
all the same people?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are you asking about this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone was convicted of that crime.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's been unconvicted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And what do you want from me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't suppose you remember
what you were doing June , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of course she doesn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Actually, I do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For good reason.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you sure you're ready for this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, we don't have to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We love each other, and...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if we're gonna take it to the next level...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First time, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sweet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His first time, too?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were devoted to each other.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that's a yes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't covering for Bennett
all this time later, are you Jane?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bennett Cahill was an angel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Angel"...yeesh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna write up her interview?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">While you're at it,
you gotta redo Clarkson's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, you wrote it in the third person.
It's gotta be in their words.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush!
We got goods.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?
- Loot at this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three pages of blah, blah, blah,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">says to Paige at the end.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget the A, go for the B."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Could be grades,
could be Al and Bennett.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not bad. / Mm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably wrote it that way
in case Al ever read it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's Heidi?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tracking her down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go you one better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Surveillance pictures of
Al Clarkson before his arrest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These were taken
at Paige's memorial service.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's Bennett doing there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have surgery in ten minutes.
Can we make this brief, please?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What were you doing Paige Pratt?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't even know her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You just like memorial services?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Feel like I'm again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess there's no reason to lie now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did know Paige...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for about an hour.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Call me when you get home?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The very moment.</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Her hair is Harlow gold, ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Her lips sweet surprise ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Her hands are never cold, ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ She's got Bette Davis eyes ♪</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi.</line>
   <line type="music">♪ She'll turn the music on you ♪</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you miss your ride?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you believe it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How far do you live?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not that far.
Six miles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can pay you for gas.</line>
   <line type="music">♪ And she'll tease you,
she'll unease you ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ All the better just to please you ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ She's precocious,
and she knows just ♪</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've always noticed you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I look for you at all the meets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I've seen you, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did you think?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought I gotta meet that girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a stupid...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a stupid thing to do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I... I had a girlfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This was the girl that I was gonna
spend the rest of my life with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but she wasn't providing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I dropped Paige at home
never saw her again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The only one who ever
existed to me was Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But after Paige died,
you felt guilty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why I went to the service.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Jane know about this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jane and I had an epic love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She couldn't know about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It would've k*lled her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You talked to Janie lately?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Breaking up was so awful, we, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we knew we could
never speak again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Paige's best friend,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you must've known about her love life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paige had a huge crush
on Bennett.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he was a senior at Jefferson,
and very taken.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was she a b*tch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah? Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, when she found out about</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paige and Bennett doing it
that one time...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she kept calling Paige up</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and saying "You're a damn sl*t"
and all this...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you know it was Jane?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, she was head
cheerleader at Jefferson</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew her squeaky little voice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you didn't tell the cops about this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It didn't seem important.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Al was such a slime bag,
we all just thought he did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Paige ever see Bennett again?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Track season was over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was still hung up on him, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wrote me all these notes about him...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm... You still have any
of those notes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I wish I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it true that Al didn't k*ll her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks that way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a wasted life, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bennett and Jane supposedly had
this epic love...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">huh...till Bennett cheats.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says Janie didn't know,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paige to tell her off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Bennett could've done it
to shut Paige up</line>
   <line type="dialogue">or Jane could've done
it out of revenge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And poor Will's sitting in lockup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not a good time</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Complicated social life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what's with the origami?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Letters from Paige to her best friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Full of dirty details about Bennett.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's another one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A little more loopy with the letters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do I get stuck doing this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm doing the fancy folding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're in the middle of dinner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta talk about Bennett and Paige.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on now, Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a one-time thing.
- Is that what he told you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He begged my forgiveness.
We moved past it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Bennett wasn't a virgin anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That must've hurt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a one-time thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not according to these.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paige wrote these notes
to her friend Heidi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're all about Bennett
and the nine times she was with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I, um...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">highlighted the good parts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was a liar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And a sl*t, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like you told her on the phone?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You should go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll just leave these for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still wanna stick with your story, Jane?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That you and Bennett hadyour
first night, June , or...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">did something else
going on that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told you what happened.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'll be meeting with Bennett
first thing tomorrow morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hopefully, your stories will match.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd it go?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll see.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was just Roxy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That the one from the other morning?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, that's Blair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So which one's your girl?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't get a girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're, uh, contacts
on the Hammond case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm still looking for a guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, in West,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we didn't write our interviews
first person.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In Homicide we do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Homicide's got the best guys, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not gonna
be the superstar your first week.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There she goes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The surgeon blowing her off?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice ride.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wants to show the old girlfriend
how good he did in life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be a good time to bring'em in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know Will Harrell's sittingin jail
right now, don't you, Bennett?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah... mm..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I feel bad about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you... you really should
be talking to Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except Jane, didn't borrow
Will's car that night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where Paige's blood ended up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I borrowed it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then let Jane take it out
with her cheerleader friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gosh!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The new stories just keep coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She came and told me what she did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I loved her,
so I helped clean up after.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When she found out about Paige
and me, she wanted one thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To see her dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How could you do that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was meaningless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was stupid. I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was gonna give myself to you,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you just threw it away
on this nobody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Th...This can't ruin what we have.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What we had is gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't be with you now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who is she?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was over
at Will's all the time, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She must've hid the g*n there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She told you she k*lled her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It'll be hard for you to understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Jane and I had something
that most people don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In our situation, it,
it didn't seem wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What situation?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our was different than other people's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You said the guy was an angel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now he's a k*ller?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This was Bennett's doing.
- That's not what he says, Janie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says you were so jealous of Paige,
you went out and shot her dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I shot her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's his position.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He came to me, crawling...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">saying he'd do anything,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">anything...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to be together again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guess what that "anything" was?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please talk to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're through, Bennett.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I have to have you back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you want me to do?
Name it. I'll do whatever you say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's nothing to do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, there is. I know there is,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I'll do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He got a g*n...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he took her out to a field...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and got her out of our lives.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Came and told me about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you kept that secret for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What else could I do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Head for the hills and call the cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think you're hearing me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He loved me so much,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he did m*rder for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've been looking through
your yearbook, Bennett.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and Janie are all over it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Best Couple."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Prom king and queen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Junior and senior prom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ah, must've been great.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't keep a girl's attention
longer than three months.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've never been lucky in love either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't call it "luck."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fate?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's closer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jane and I used to say
that we were as...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">as Halley's Comet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's amazing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Too bad you ruined it with
that fling with Paige.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't ruin it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No? How do you make up
for some like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We figured out a way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got no chance at Halley's Comet...
neither does he...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so we really need you
to help us understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We made a plan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know what we can do.
- You do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know how we can be togehter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If we k*ll her, we can erase her,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then you'll be a virgin again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's to save us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll have to take my word for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It made sense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bennett told us
how it went, Janie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How what went?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bout the g*n, the barbells.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what you mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How you were gonna sink her
in the river after.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">believe you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bout Halley's Comet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He told you about that?</line>
