   <line type="dialogue">If that's possible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil, you want to take a look at this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Regional broadcast
from Delaware State Police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They just got a m*rder similar to
a cold job in Jersey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Young white male,
walked into the woods,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Both were hitchhikers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Motive?
- Straight robbery.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">b*llet in both cases was . caliber.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Requesting information on
any like murders,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">solved or unsolved, in the region."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, they think they got
a serial m*rder?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like it.
- Nice. I'll check the H-records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had a job like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, a kid hitchhiking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Five, six years ago.
Danny Saltzman's job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saltzman. Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you remember about it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was in the Summer.
And just like you said,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in the forest, hitchhiker, . slug.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember his name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I should remember.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saltzy brayed on and on about that kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There wasn't much on it,
some footprints, fiber.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, he just turned ,
uh... "Gone good."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saltzman was always saying.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crummy kid gone good", over and over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a good-looking kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saltzman had his picture taped up
on the wall.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn, this name thing's gonna bug me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever establish who the kid
caught a ride with?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, case went cold fast.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dean... I think his name was Dean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, it wasn't Dean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Darren... Darren something.
- No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?
- Mills. Matt Mills.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right. That's it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Almost had it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt Mills, ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">shot in the woods off the Expressway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The , bucks he'd just won
in Atlantic City, gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like the other two jobs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I talked to Jersey and Delaware,
both are thinking it's the same doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Serial k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our guy Matt could've been his first.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Matt's k*lled in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jersey's body turns up fall of .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Delaware's just four weeks ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A three-year cooling off period.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I say we go right now.
To Delaware.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No need.
Delaware's coming here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't get too excited, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A serial job don't get you
hopped up just a little, boss?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What else do we know
about the victims, Lil?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All young guys, to .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All three were headed home
from Atlantic City</line>
   <line type="dialogue">after winning a few thousand
in the casinos.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So the doer hangs around the tables,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">st*lks the winners,
catches up to them</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on the lonely road home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These kids are leaving
with thousands of bucks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are they hitchhiking?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">File says Matt missed his bus back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could win ten grand over there,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I still ain't paying a cabbie
bucks to drive me home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, you put it that way,
I guess my tumb's out too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Besides the robbery and the . ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we got a size ten print that
lines up with other murders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus the gray carpet fiber
on the body.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Delaware and Jersey
have a list of seven suspects</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that could've done both jobs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Add in this m*rder,
maybe we narrow it down even more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera and Jeffries can check
the list, see if anyone</line>
   <line type="dialogue">had ties to Philly in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm. / What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When Matt was ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">my Sergeant at West Detectives.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Him and his cousin robbed
a food mart. Got probation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll put a call in,
see if he remembers Matt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Better get to the family, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let them know what's going on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hello.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Katie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm Detective Rush.
- Detective Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are your parents home?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it about Matt?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whenever it's cops,
it's about Matt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Matt was in Atlantic City</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine that weekend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt hadn't seen Blaine
for a long time,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he wanted to go whoop it up with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, he'd earned it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How so?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was working for a brokerage house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An entry level position,
but a good start.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'd gotten into computers,
that investment world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was impressive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">During the days,
he was hustling at his jobs,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">nights he was over at Drexel
taking classes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Folks he worked for liked him,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but Matt knew he needed his B.A.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like your son really stepped up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After that trouble he
and Blaine got into.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A footnote in our file mentions
the food mart robbery.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't a footnote to us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt had some... very bad years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First, he was stealing
money off my dresser,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">then breaking into the neighbor's house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm glad he robbed that store.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He became a different
person after that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Scared straight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That didn't straighten him out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He straightened himself out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a difference.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That kid...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had what it takes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, the next three years,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt was the boy we'd always
dreamed we'd have.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And what about Blaine?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine's still over in Atlantic City.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You the guys from Philly?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine Robbins.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gotta admit, um...
I'm not that glad to see you guys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dragging up Matty's ghost
has me feeling kind of funky.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you want his m*rder solved?
- Definitely.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, he missed his bus.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told him stay, but
he had to be at work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I would've given him a
ride myself, but no wheels.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you remember anyone watching Matt
that night, haning around him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I wasn't with him at the time,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but Matt is a... was....
a real approachable guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's talk about that robbery
you and Matt did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those were our bad years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kids who needed a thousand bucks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A thousand bucks for what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Start a vending machine business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, like a Coke machine?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Candy bars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was a machine for sale
for $ , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the idea was,
after we stocked it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt and I could clear $</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a week!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Young guys, thinking big.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah... Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything else about that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I...
I was kind of hammered.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Been celerbrating all night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Celebrating what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matty had become a real entrepreneur.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This rockin' investment opportunity
had just come our way...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So this Click Twice
stock is a sure thing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For us to get in on an IPO,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the broker would be doing us
a major favor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that would get us in
on the ground floor,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">right where you wanna be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The stock'll sh**t right up,
that's why everyone wants in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then it'll re-set,
find its real value.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But, by that time,
you and me have already cashed out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Millionaires by age .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We would've made out like bandits.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">without Matty, the deal...
went up in smoke.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's our list doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Getting shorter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two guys were in jail in ' ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">three others have good,
substantiated whereabouts</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at the time of Matt's m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that leaves two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh. Meet Sam Royal,
Delaware State Police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's it going?
- Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Down to one, huh? / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My suspect number
two was in a hospital</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in Bridgeport having dialysis
the night Matt was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So who's that leave?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Henry Floyd.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Truck dirver with a three-page sheet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a convicted thief,
con artist, attempted r*pist...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like you know him pretty good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. I interviewed him.
He's got ice water in his veins.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And a size ten shoe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">g*ns?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got three registered hand g*ns,
including a . Smith and Wesson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, and, uh... Mac
withdrawls puts Floyd</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in the AC casinos the night
before each of the murders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gas receipts also put him
near the crime scenes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm liking Floyd more and more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, when I asked him about these kids,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the cocky S.O.B. smiles at me
and tells me</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he never picks up hitchhikers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was cocky about that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never mentioned hitchhikers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna meet this guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got copies of his logs,
he's due back tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's he stay in Philly?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, he's got ties
to a woman out in Bristol.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's the tie?
- Girlfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Name's Janice Burns.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yep...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm the girlfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That always sounds so silly.
- Why is that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I look like a girly-girl to you,
Hot Stuff?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Besides, um... I wouldn't exactly...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">consider what we got
a traditional situation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you have?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Henry comes here for one thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two, if he decides to stay
and eat up all my food.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That doesn't sound like
you get much out of this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why you let him in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because if I don't,
he'll get his tool box</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and he'll take the door off the hinges.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's done it before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who knew you'd be better off
leaving your door unlocked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Janice, you never called
the police, filed charges?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nope.
- Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know what he'd do to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I made my bed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The only reason I met Henry</line>
   <line type="dialogue">was I was at the truck stops
looking for dates.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And now that animal's been
in my life for ten years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew what I was doing was risky.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, tomorrow is just another day?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's tomorrow?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Henry's coming to town.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't know that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He hasn't called you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I said, I leave the door open.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ah, don't worry about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Janice, you say Henry's been trampling
in and out of here the last ten years?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And how long have you had this gray carpet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, lab going to do a rush job
on that fiber?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll have the results
by the end of the day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You check on Floyd?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On schedule. Should arrive
at Muncy's Meats by noon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It'll take him at least another
minutes to get out to Janice's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll go early and wait for him.
- Royal's already on his way over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's got it bad for this guy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got a few hours.
Wanna take a ride, see my old Sergeant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He called back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He remembers the arrest?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just says he's in the office.
We should swing by.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Scotty Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's Homicide treating you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't all bad.
How's things here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good and quiet with you gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manny, this is
my new partner, Lilly Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice to meet you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's that DC number on that
arrest I was talking about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two kids robbing a food mart, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let me grab the ...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cousins.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of the kids, Matt Mills,
ended up dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt was younger of the two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Him mom said getting locked up
scared Matt pretty good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know if it was so much
about being locked up</line>
   <line type="dialogue">as it was that Russian
reading him the riot act.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Russian is the store owner?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Ivan Medvedenko.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Made a scene out here
you wouldn't forget too easy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so I took the phone, dialed .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I should've ran after them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, calling was the right thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That is one, right there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You stole from me!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shame on you.
Your dirty hands.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lazy, American boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Calm down, Ivan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How old are you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seventeen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Too late.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Too late for what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Change.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll always be spoiled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Die!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just, die.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A boy like you no one will miss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Johnny, take this man downstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Russian tells Matt to die.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything behind those words?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First detectives on that kid's
m*rder came asking the same,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but Medvedenko had no record.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wonder if Matt and Blaine
ever want back to his store.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If they were dumb enough to do that,
then I'd say all bets were off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Working with a girl, huh.
- Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She a political case?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, she came from North.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did real good there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Floyd just got to town.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gotta go. Thanks, Manny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Henry Floyd?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Philadelphia Police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sit down, Henry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get you some coffee?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure you can't offer me more
than that, sweet tits?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh... you and me are gonna
some problems, Henry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's okay, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna do me, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not sure yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Twirl around once.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Scotty, give me and Henry
some private time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've been naughty, Henry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three murders along your truck route.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We've been charting where you've been
and what you've done,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and not just us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jersey and Delaware cops are
on your a*s, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Am I under arrest?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're free to go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want to?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I'm enjoying myself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have copies of your trucking logs,
credit card receipts,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">day-to-day map of your whereabouts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dolly, none of that means
nothing and you know it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Actually, one good piece of
physical evidence</line>
   <line type="dialogue">can mean everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we have fibers, Floyd.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from Janice's carpet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, you've seen Janice?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you know what an upgrade you'd be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three m*rder trials in three states.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyway you look at it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you'll get the needle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt Mills.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ended his life for $ , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever think on that?
- I don't get your meaning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, what's the lowest you'd
end someone's life for?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a Swiss Army Knife?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dolly, you and me...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we don't see the world the same way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, you're a Philosopher.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that gives you the right
to take someone's life away?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're putting words in my mouth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll him, didn't k*ll anyone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then take a polygraph for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you m*rder Matt Mills?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you k*ll Chuck Praska?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chuck get iced in Jersey or Delaware?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes or no answers, Floyd.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Roger that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you m*rder Chuck Praska?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you m*rder Brian Fritz?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The next question
I want you to answer incorrectly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The purpose is to intentionally
make the chart spike.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is this card the ace of spades?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He never spiked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not even when he lied about the card.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He beat the polygraph.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, you never should have
gone to see Janice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now s perfectly good ten-year
relationship will have to end.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gonna k*ll her, too, Henry?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like those three kids?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're putting words
in my mouth again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you looking at?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A dead man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And get those feet off my table.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The ball on Floyd's left
boot is severely worn down,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">probably from pressing down
on the clutch when he's in his rig.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First time around,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">criminalistics looked at
the brand, size, and tread.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe they never looked at
the ball of the foot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So let's pull the molds from evidence,
re-submit them to the lab.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna that Jersey know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey.
- See you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lot of wear and tear
on Floyd's left hoof.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If the plaster molds
match, we got him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good. 'Cause the fiber match
didn't happen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crap.
- Inconclusive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I got something else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manny called back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ran that store owner
through the computer again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Starting ' , he does have a sheet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arrested for assaulting one of
his customers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then five months ago...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">chased a shoplifter with a revolver.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fired six sh*ts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of revolver?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">. Special.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just like the one that k*lled Matt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Better go have a conversation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Philadelphia Homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We wanna ask you some question.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I haven't done anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're investigating the m*rder
of a young man you had history with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Recognize him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know who that boy is, don't you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He robbed me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Him and the other.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Held you at gunpoint, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like animals.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you doing there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry, pops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you don't get away,
I'll call the police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get away, I said!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thief!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't move!
- Thief!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't move! Don't move!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matty, hurry!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't move!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You shouldn't have chased me out.
Why you gotta make things complicated?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matty, hurry!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They never saw Pejia,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">my son,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and for that... I am thankful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you must've held a grudge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your meaning?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those boys got arrested
but only got probation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did that get you mad, Ivan?
- They should've gone to jail.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And since they didn't, maybe you
decided to do something about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aah, three years later?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember how many years later
Matt got k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You heard that kid got m*rder*d, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Everyone talked about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You recall where you
were the day he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here. Working, like always.
- Can you prove it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I leave people alone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've never hurt anyone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, you leave people alone</line>
   <line type="dialogue">outside of when you sh**t your g*n
off at them, is that it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't have a g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Medvedenko, we're cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know about you firing sh*ts
at the shoplifter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The neighbors told police
you had a . Special.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No g*n was found. Go on, check.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's 'cause you got rid of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please, leave my store.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna tell us about
the g*n, otherwise</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you look suspicious, Ivan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I sold it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To who? / Back to whom
I bought if from Mr. Joey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Joey?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You saying Joey's, his last name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He just has hot g*ns.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At his pawn store.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll never find it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna find Mr.Joey.
Follow that g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Molds came back.
- The ball on the left foot?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Worn down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Perfect match...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for Jersey and Delaware.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about our job?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, Floyd didn't k*ll Matt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But it absolutely puts him away
for the other two hitchhiker jobs,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't thank you enough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anytime.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Floyd'll go down to holding
until Jersey can get here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can fight over him down there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks, Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't have done it without you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, you just solved two murders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's pretty decent.
- We didn't solve our m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt's our job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt's sister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, Katie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi. Is it okay I'm here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure. Your parents with you?
- No. I got the address off your card.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, I'm gonna go find Mr. Joey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What can I do for you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted to know about Matty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause no one tells me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and... I mean, I miss him, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you wanna know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know who k*lled him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine said a serial k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're close to Blaine, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He tells me things,
not like my parents.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, your parents probably
just wanna keep you young,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Katie, as long as possible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt treated me like a grown-up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine's just like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Real nice,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">really, really smart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Smart, huh? / He knows how
to do all kinds of stuff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He can fly a plane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine's a pilot?
- He has his license.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And later this year,
he's starting a restaurant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, a nightclub kind of place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got some seed money
saved up to invest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like you got business
in your blood, Katie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like Matty did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He called me that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Before he died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm coming home tomorrow, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You made a lot of money?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you'll buy me something?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I already did.
- What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sand dollars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What else did you do there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ran into somebody I knew.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sort of got into a fight with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It brought up some bad feelings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matty?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Besides the sand dollars,
could you bring taffy, too?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure. Taffy, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was only ten.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't think about what he said.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But now I'm thinking that maybe</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it mattered that he ran into someone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It might.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for telling me now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He first came by after
them two kids robbed him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Said he had to have a g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gave him the . .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then all was quiet for, like, years</line>
   <line type="dialogue">till he ran wild on that shoplifter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After that craziness, he came back,
wanting to move that g*n real quick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need to get that g*n, Jeoy.
Where is it now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I only had it another week.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It went back out hot?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah. I'm riding on the boulevard,
minding my own business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These bozos on patrol pulled me over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wonder why.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The bastard said I ran a light.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Next thing you know,
they're confiscating</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that . out of my glove box,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I'm on my way back to court.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did the Judge say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ordered that g*n destroyed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wasn't such a loss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I might've had a body on it anyway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How well you know this Ivan Medvedenko?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well enough to stay out of his way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's his deal?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When he first came to the neighborhood,
he was actually kind of nice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had this idea America was gonna
treat him and his kid right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Didn't work out that way?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He hated all them lowlifes
hanging around,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">homeless trying to get
free stuff from him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When he came asking for that g*n,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">talking about lazy
kids needing a lesson,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he had some... glint in his eye.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kind of scared me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Morning.
- Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Over losing Floyd?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All about Medvedenko now.
- What changed?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've been trying to connect Medvedenko</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to Atlantic City the weekend
Matt was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guess who won a Center City Bank
sweepstakes, June of ' ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Medvedenko.
- His wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Prize was a free gambling
junket in Atlantic City,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">trip for two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Medvedenko said he was working.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guess he wasn't working.
- Oh, it's gonna be a good day for us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bad one for Medvedenko.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You lied to me, Ivan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew you'd bring me in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That you'd suspect me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those are some good instincts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm innocent.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When did you come to this country, Ivan?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">dark times in Russia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Walk lightly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Very lightly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Must have felt good to finally
get to America.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Since I was a boy, it was my dream...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to work...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">make your own life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What a gift.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then one day, two
good-for-nothing boys,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who didn't think much of that
gift, came and robbed you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll that boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Take a seat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't lie to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were in Atlantic City,
so was Matt Mills.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.
- Yes, what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, I saw him in Atlantic City.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw him, did not k*ll him!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I-I-I don't want any trouble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't want trouble?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't want trouble either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My son, Pejia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't remember him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he was there when you robbed me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He saw!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sir, I regret what we did,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">an-and I heard what you said to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tell Pejia if he works hard,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he can be anything he wants.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he says, "Dad,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">why work hard when people
can just take your money?"</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You did that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sir...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">all I can do is say I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you shake his hands?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because sorry wasn't good enough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And who would miss this kid anyway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If he died, who would
miss a boy like him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember saying that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There he goes,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">lying to me again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You already lied to me about the g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You lied about leaving people alone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lied about your whereabouts
the day of the m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, who do you think
you're lying to, Ivan?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm the police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.
- Are you sure?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because you wanna see your son again,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd better start hearing some I believe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're going away, Medvedenko.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll disappear?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll make me disappear?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or Pejia?
- Hey, you're damn right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna keep lying, Medvedenko?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Poof! Now start talking about
how you k*lled Matt Mills.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have to see my son again.
- Tell me about the . you got from Joey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How you took Matt in your car</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and marched that kid into the woods</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but don't you lie!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hate a liar!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I k*lled him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You want me to feel sorry for you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You m*rder*d a kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll write what you want.
- I write, you talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's got to be first person.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The other one deserved death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What other one? Blaine?
- He put the g*n to my head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was there that night, too, Ivan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You could've had a twofer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw him outside the casino,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could say anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He went.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll notify Matt's family, his cousin...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't know what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine told us he would've given
Matt a ride home,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but he didn't have wheels.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Medvedenko said he saw
Blaine driving away in a car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, Medvedenko's lying.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe, but you should check it out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We did. DMV shows Blaine
didn't own a car in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But AutoTrack just gave me
a secondary address</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on Blaine for all of ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A magazine subscription
was sent to his workplace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What workplace?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Roll-The-Dice Rentals.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A rent-a-car company.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Would have given Blaine
access to a car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Medvedenko just confessed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, why would he go
if he didn't do it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because you got him wetting his pants.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You figured out where he lives,
and you went there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't that our job?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Scotty, you ask a guy like that</line>
   <line type="dialogue">again, maybe he thinks KGB.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he thinks you're saying
you're gonna k*ll his kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Make him disappear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was a good interview.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's make sure of that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got a lot of power in that room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's one more trip to Atlantic City.
We can afford that, can't we?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Before we put away father of
an -year-old forever?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's gonna be one fun
ride, I'll tell you that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can't get a car for another hour.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay. / It's pretty pathethic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The department don't get
enough cars to go around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're just now noticing
our crap resources?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't take a tone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was just about to say that to you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just hung up with
the Atlantic City Flying Club.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine shelled out $ ,
in October ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Exact amount stolen off of Matt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Four months after he died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Case was cold by then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know Blaine didn't
have a lot of cash flow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">all at once is significant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but do you k*ll your buddy
just so you can take flying lessons?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This wasn't for recreation.
He was gonna start a business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Another business?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The plan was to buy a Cessna
and go into aerial advertising.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like one of them planes with the
banner flying over Eagle games?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, for "Ted's TV and Stereo",
whatever.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, what happened?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The $ , got him through
instruction, not to his license.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine never became a pilot.
- Another brainstorm down the drain.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he didn't k*ll Matt for the money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's his motive?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They hadn't seen each other in a while.
Maybe they grew apart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know Matt changed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine's looking like the
mope he's always been.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could rub a guy the wrong way if your
prodigy grows up different than you did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Especially if that kid looked up
to you the way Katie does now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's go see about that car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If Blaine took a car out that day,
I don't have the paperwork.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about mileage that's not
accounted for? You track that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Give me a second.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of course, all this tells me</line>
   <line type="dialogue">is if a car went out on
such and such a day,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Understood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, here's something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One vehicle does show
some missing miles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">miles on a Honda Accord.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About the round-trip distance
between here and the crime scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure glad I fired that kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did you fire Blaine?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One morning he showed up with a g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw it in his duffel bag.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd you do about it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I took the g*n,
I turned it into the cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a tough guy to find, Blaine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've been upstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got on a bit of a streak this morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The house comped me a room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, number two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, two horse.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even a permanent address,
I couldn't find one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't got one right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where were you living last?
- With some chick. It's a long story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Been there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Drink?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Em..Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, what you're having.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, two, two, two, two...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn it!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We talked to your cousin Katie
the other day, Blaine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah? I love that kid.
Smart, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Funny, she said that about you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Told me about the nightclub, bar
restaurant thing, you're getting started.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like a hot move.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could' been big,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but some backers just dropped out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Deal fell through.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same old, same old, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You just seem to run into that a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, this restaurant deal,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and that airplane venture before that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Candy bar machine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why you taking sh*ts?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those aren't sh*ts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Part of me feels for you, Blaine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When a someone's bad at
what they want to be good at,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that's not easy to deal with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know about Roll-the-Dice
Rentals, Blaine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How you took the car out that day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's no record of that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a record of the mileage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably didn't think
it through that far, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Didn't cover your tracks
with that g*n too good, either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bringing it to work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now A.C. police have it inventoried.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And spending Matt's three
grand at the flying school...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kind of a half-baked
plan, huh, Blaine?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kind of a familiar theme for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm good at business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt was the one working for
a brokerage house,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">making connections.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I taught Matt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A -year-old with enough
moxie to get in on an IPO.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You said you were happy
about that, but maybe it hurt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matt being the guy who was
the one making things happen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I made that happen!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The IPO was my idea.
The whole damn things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Millionaires by age .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Salud.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine, put the drink down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In theory, everything you're
saying is great.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now let's talk specifics.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, yeah, let's talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who are the principals behind this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These McSorley Brothers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's their dot com.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And who's underwriting?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you'd want to find that out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, Ronnie Mack says
we got to jump on this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine, IPO's are all based on hype.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can't just go on what</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this pit boss buddy of
yours is telling you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When I get back to the office</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll see what an analyst thinks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ship's gonna sail.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta pull the trigger on
this day after next.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then why we having this conversation?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You said we needed grand to get in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where are we gonna get grand?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A casino.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A casino?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've been casing this place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here we go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you doing?
Cover that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They got an open cage here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're in and out in seconds.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you crazy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Watch how you're talking to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine, you gotta wake up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Always with the pipe dream.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's getting stupid.
- Blah, blah, blah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget you, pal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm doing this one myself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not gonna let you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not gonna let me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll walk over to the cage right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tip'em off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Listen, he don't wanna go along?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But saying he's gonna stop me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For my own good?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That runt used to wear
my hand-me-downs!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now he's gonna big-man me like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on. Get in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you stop. I swear, Matty,
I blow your head off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right. All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go to that tree.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Turn around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Listen, Blaine, you're gonna rob me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Take the three grand from the tables.
You can have it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shut the hell up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm talking now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've known me longer than anybody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did you look at me like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're still doing it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Put your head down.
I don't wanna see your face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do it!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing's changed, Matty!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Suddenly, you're looking at me like
you don't know what the hell I'm doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All I need is a break.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One break and I'm on my way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've always known that</line>
   <line type="dialogue">since we were kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were the only one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blaine...
- Shut up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's nothing for you to say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna see it...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in your eyes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matty, I need one thing to go my way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And no one's gonna tell me different.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now you look up at me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you show me you still know that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just one break...</line>
