   <line type="dialogue">This domestic call</line>
   <line type="dialogue">came in every Friday night...
same damn couple.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're finally shut'em down with
the Blind Policeman routine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blind Policeman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We go to their door with
a white stick and glasses,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">start taking down their report.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell'em it's an equal opportunity program.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grope their faces.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're so thrown off
they don't call for weeks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever do Blind Policeman</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in your patrol days?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gets'em every time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The, um...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The lady from Milwaukee is here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She called twice yesterday
for directions.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she's an hour early.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mrs. Holtz?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know I'm early. I can wait.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, no, it's fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm Detective Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is Detective Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it true Milwaukee smells like beer?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've lived there too long to know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I haven't been here for a while.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What brings you now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My son was m*rder*d here in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a student.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A robbery?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They said it was, at first,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then they said something else...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They said he'd been at a gay bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My husband and I told them</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that was wrong, that Danny</line>
   <line type="dialogue">had a girlfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The world has changed so much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was your son's name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Daniel Holtz.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please, have a seat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't know your son was gay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't wanna know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And now, much too late,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I realize...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that kept me from really knowing him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cops back then</line>
   <line type="dialogue">talk about other leads?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They mostly talked</line>
   <line type="dialogue">about my husband and I being "nice people."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have a heart condition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Triple bypass.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm running on fumes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If there's one thing
I want to settle before I go...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think the police swept this
under the rug.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And my husband and I helped them do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We didn't push.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll pull his case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">COLD CASE x</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't see a box.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holtz with a "Z".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know. There's no box.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tough to live with, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She must have told</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the assigned detective to lay off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A civilian tells you to lay off,
you do it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I go harder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They got jumbled up a lot?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's getting better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">People are learning the alphabet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except Vera.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not every case is a box job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If there isn't enough to fill a box...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here it is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Living in a group home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Skimpy, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doesn't say High Priority.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Body was found in the alley</line>
   <line type="dialogue">behind a bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In Queen Village. It's perfect.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This case gonna make you uneasy there, Scotty?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nope.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">' ? That's back when patrol cars were red.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm. Random street m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Assigned detectives are both dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A gay bashing outside a bar
that don't exist anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any you have three civilian interviews.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like a winner, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got a shot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joined the patron saints of lost causes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't lost if I'm looking for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whoo, got him to drink the Kool-Aid?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So where you two gonna start?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crime scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Queen Village.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That cracks him up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Take Jeffries.
Maybe he remembers the bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone saw what happened.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone always does that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So we'll fine'em. Knock on doors.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ask neighborhood people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone'll remember our guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Another optimist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Hush Room was over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Corner of Sodom and Gomorrah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that what the cops called it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's what the residents called it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Neighborhood's changed?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Night and day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All the neighbors are long gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yuppies pushed'em out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If it was so crappy</line>
   <line type="dialogue">how come this Penn kid came
all the way down here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you were in gay ' ,
this was the only game in town.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you wanted to socialize,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this was the only place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So why was Danny in this alley?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got chased. Or ambushed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or lucky.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How would he have gotten back to
campus in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Subway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The other direction from the Hush Room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he found a friend
who lived thataway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Caller saw the body</line>
   <line type="dialogue">splayed and protruding in the alley..."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who called it in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anonymous.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Boy, you got nada.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got a neighbor who saw nothing,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a bartender who knew nothing</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and a drag queen called Tinkerbell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus a note tossed in that
Tinkerbell had a lead</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on who liked to kick q*eer a*s
in the neighborhood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let me guess. No follow-up, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tinkerbell could have been</line>
   <line type="dialogue">been a good ID, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like a g*ng moniker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's how we find the thugs now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna look for Tinkerbell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In Never-Never Land?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or drag bars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You sure that's the best job for me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Definitely.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We should check the old arrest books</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at the District Station House.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Figure out who the area bullies were.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go to the district house with you,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you troll the bars with me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure. I ain't scared.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what violations are we looking for?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There wasn't a code for hate crimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Certainly weren't calling it
"gay bashing".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So.... male-on-male assaults?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">as*ault, drunk and disorderly,
disturbing the peace,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the whole constellation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">South Philly thugs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I probably got</line>
   <line type="dialogue">relatives in this book.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Hush Room was managed</line>
   <line type="dialogue">by Anthony DeSica from ' to ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll go and see him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our boss, Lieutenant Stillman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, I remember.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mrs. Holtz.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank you for looking at this case again,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so much time later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, no case is too old to open again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never asked before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Does it say in there
how exactly Danny died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blunt force trauma.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Beaten?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, with a round, wooden implement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Baseball bat, maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, that would be too awful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There wasn't much Danny loved
more than baseball.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was on the Penn team.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He must have been a decent player.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shortstop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In your original interview, Helen,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you mention Danny's fiancee.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, girlfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He said "his girlfriend", at least.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The fiancee part maybe was
my wishful thinking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about other friends?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny had a lot of friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone that could have been
a romantic interest?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looking back?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think he'll be there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We are early.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know,
but my feet are k*lling me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Liberty Bell isn't that fascinating.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, I hear him. Danny, it's us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Honey, are you there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, Mom, uh, just a second.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is a friend from the Law School.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were just studying.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you guys weren't coming back
till later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm late.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've gotta go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So nice to meet you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you guys have a good time?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had a great time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your mother loved it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What time are we meeting Deborah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't even know that boy's name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know so little about his life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Would Deborah know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Last I heard of her, she was
applying to med school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember her last name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could get it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She wrote us an awfully nice note
when Danny died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you find that boy...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">or whoever was important to Danny...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">will you let him know I'm here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You, uh, still wanna go to the scene, ma'am?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I'm feeling too tired now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll walk you out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Queen Village</line>
   <line type="dialogue">bullies and thugs, circa .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We extrapolated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You boys have fun tonight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We wanna talk to you about
the Hush Room, Anthony.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why you asking about ancient history?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's the business we're in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ralphie, finish this, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone in the place don't need to know</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I worked in a q*eer bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My uncle owned it. What can I say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wasn't his favorite nephew.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got the booby prize job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember this kid, Danny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I liked him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a baseball nut.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was the year</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the Phillies choked on the pennant race.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were eight and a half games ahead,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then they blew</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ten straight in a row.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So I had something to talk with him about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any idea who k*lled him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everybody hated those people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about a drag queen called Tinkerbell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You friendly with her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were all Tinkerbells to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember the night Danny died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, 'cause of the raid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cops was raiding us all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, we paid them off</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to tip us as to when they were coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did you do with the information?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had a red light behind the bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If people were dancing</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and the red light started,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they knew to hurry up</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and get into boy-girl couples
before the cops got there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only that night there was no warning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How come?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe my uncle was late with the payoff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cops ever do any damage?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those kind of raids was open season
on them f*gs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's nothing on the books</line>
   <line type="dialogue">about a police raid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're surprised?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This raid happened</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the night of a m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's pretty significant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, well, things were different</line>
   <line type="dialogue">back then, Scott.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The department isn't squeaky-clean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a lot that's ugly in our past.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, now we got two secret worlds</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to break into...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">gays and the history of the department.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know about Russo's Raiders?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Heard stories.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Captain John Russo had an elite squad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They took care of businesses...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">payoffs, raids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably gay bashing, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, how do we find out
what cops were on this raid?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not from the records, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That stuff was off the books.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do we find out if Danny was beaten</line>
   <line type="dialogue">with a nightstick, and not a bat?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We should stop calling them drag queens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How come?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think the last guy was offended.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought they call themselves
drag queens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't mean we can.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it a slur? I don't think it is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about cross-dresser?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not offensive, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, it's neutral.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right, let's go with that one
this time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, how's it going?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Super.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're, uh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">looking for an older gentlemen...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who goes by the name of Tinkerbell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't know him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got any old-timers that hang out here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's an older crowd
in the rooms upstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What rooms?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The conversation rooms.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, we're not vice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't care about your rooms.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking for a witness.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go on up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just watch your body language</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if you don't wanna get groped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny's mom said</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you two dated in college.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mmm. I found about Danny the hard way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I caught him and Hank kissing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everything's a big lie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're just a liar, using me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing has to change.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, I do love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But, not the way you're supposed to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not as much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">As much as what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">As I love him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you k*ll him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, that would solve our case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, we became friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh. Gotta run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, can we walk with you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know how to deliver a baby?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can learn anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, I always wondered</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if it was just a random street thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something really bad was happening
in his life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think Danny was being blackmailed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He needed a chunk of money,
and obviously</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he hadn't gotten a girl in trouble,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">as we used to say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then I think,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">why would anyone blackmail Danny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He didn't have a cent.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He borrowed toothpaste.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oops, last warning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um, did you know his boyfriend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hank? Mmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ambitious, "Master of the Universe" type.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Law student.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's Hank's last name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hank... oh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's the screwdriver?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Phillips?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hank Phillips.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what became of him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny didn't deserve what happened to him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And even though I'm the one who got</line>
   <line type="dialogue">her heart broken...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny wasn't cruel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The world was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The story is Tinkerbell had a nipple ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Way ahead of his time with that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyway, in one of his many a*s kickings,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a guy took a knife</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and tried to slice that ring right off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But there's a happy ending.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tink got the nipple reconstructed for free</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at the VA hospital.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A doc there wrote it up as a combat wound</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she got fighting in Korea.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, Tinkerbell was in the Army?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know this doc's name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or Tinkerbell's?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But that old queen sure got beaten up a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone at the VA may know her real name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for your time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you got?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A question I need answered.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Quietly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The case is from .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need to know about a w*apon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, no problem.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, this is Shelly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's gonna do that research for us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On the QT?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mum's the word.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera should be finding true love
right about now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Back in ' ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tinkerbell came forward voluntarily.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wanted to talk about being assaulted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tinkerbell's not a joke.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So far she's our most promising lead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got another one...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from the law school alumni office.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You found Hank?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah. Still lives in Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Henry Phillips.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That Henry Phillips?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your Honor. Detective Rush, Homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm here on a personal matter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A personal matter of yours?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of yours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've reopened the Daniel Holtz case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and he were both at Penn in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was m*rder*d.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I understand you were close friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not sure I can get into this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have no interest in prying into
your personal life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm just trying to solve a homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking into the theory
it was a hate crime.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A gay bashing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who brought that theory to the table?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't remember him well enough to help you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, take my card</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in case something jogs your memory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like the fact that you cared about him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't talk publicly</line>
   <line type="dialogue">about... these things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd like to help you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I need assurances...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's between you and me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No notes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you wanna know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Danny being blackmailed?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His friend Deborah</line>
   <line type="dialogue">said he needed money all of a sudden.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wasn't being blackmailed. I was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By who?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The management</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at a certain bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Hush Room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went to that rat hole with Danny twice,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and almost had my life ruined.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were running an extortion scam
out of there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And a young law student</line>
   <line type="dialogue">was a good target.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You couldn't be a lawyer
if you were gay back then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Moral turpitude.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, why was Danny trying to get money</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if you were the one blackmailed?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He felt responsible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was responsible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't mind being behind closed doors,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but Danny wanted to be out, on a scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That make you angry?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think I k*lled him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In a disgusting alley...
as a career move?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not my best theory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know who really hated Danny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His teammates on the baseball team.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, these yours?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know this place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you go there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I may have, yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">f*gg*t.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From that day on,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they made things really bad for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Beaned him on purpose.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wouldn't sit with him on the bus.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ended up quitting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But, in these days,
there was no such thing</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not at Penn or anywhere else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank you</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for talking to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need it to stay confidential.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's one person</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd like to tell about our conversation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny's Mom's in town.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She'd like to hear from you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear you're running a dice game</line>
   <line type="dialogue">out of your warehouse, Anthony.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dice game. What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. I heard Bingo, dogfights.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, all kinds of things to write you up on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, you guys what do you want with me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell us about</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the extortion scam.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Extortion? Why would we do that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You tell us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We was printing money,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">selling watered-down drinks to the q*eers,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and it'd be bad for business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Talk about bad for business...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">how much, uh,
you charge for the dice game?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ah, come on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My moron cousin hid a camera,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">tried to hit up a couple of guys,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">looked like they had something to lose.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My uncle almost ripped his throat out</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when he found out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For the reasons I cited above.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bad for business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My uncle shut him down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">End of story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Believe me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">my cousin was way too small-time to
plan a m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The raid that night... I need a name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They taped over their name tags.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You usually got warning.
Who gave it to you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The bagman for the District Captain.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The guy who picked up</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the payoff envelopes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Contributions</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to the police Athletic Foundation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a rookie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nelson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Officer Nelson</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at the bar the night Danny was k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was always there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's very helpful, Anthony.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. This is not a put-on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He went by the name Tinkerbell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A Korean w*r vet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His chest area got</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in a little accident with a knife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">guys named Nelson on the job
in the ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So we track them all down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A cross-dresser. Had a nipple ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Penn baseball team?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were in Ithaca, New York</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the weekend of your m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An away game.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The entire lineup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You look that up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I happen to have every
sports record known to man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Memorized.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">less guys you got to check out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have so many other suspects,
it's sad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blackmail ring, rogue cops,
neighborhood thugs...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No shortage of people</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who had it in for a gay kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got the results you asked for.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I called in a favor at the FBI lab.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We used a pig's head to simulate
the bruise and wound pattern</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for the w*apon, and then compared that</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to the victim photographs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that kid was not</line>
   <line type="dialogue">k*lled with a nighstick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's a relief.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank the pig.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your guess about the w*apon?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My money's on the classic baseball bat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I found Tinkerbell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Real name... George Polk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Polk?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">George Polk?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Rush, Philadelphia Police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm here about the m*rder</line>
   <line type="dialogue">of Daniel Holtz outside the Hush Room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanted to give a statement to police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm here to take it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It took you a while to get back to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, it did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Decided to get dressed up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, in my day, I was beaten up</line>
   <line type="dialogue">by every cop and f*g basher</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in South Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm. Cops beat you up for no reason?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The reason, young man, was hatred.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And career advancement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, Captain Russo</line>
   <line type="dialogue">loved his f*g-bashing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can only speculate why.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These are mug sh*ts</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from the early ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arrests out of the Third District.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is there a magnifier?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These are old eyes,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you know, they need help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I ask you something?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did you flaunt the way you were</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if you knew people were gonna attack you for it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a homicide detective?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's new.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">With what you see</line>
   <line type="dialogue">people do, you get upset 'bout
how a man dresses,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and who he loves?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't upset.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm just wondering, if you're getting</line>
   <line type="dialogue">beaten up 'cause you dress like a woman,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you don't wanna get beat up,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">why not stop dressing like a woman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause I was never a practical girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, he's one of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of who?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The local monster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember his eyebrows.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was the ringleader.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you remember him doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember him hitting me and kicking me</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and throwing things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're sure about him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sure. His mother would egg him on</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from the window of their little slum.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And his name</line>
   <line type="dialogue">is Brian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Timmy O'Brien.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lived around the corner</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from the Hush Room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fourth floor window, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Apartment .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If the local thugs</line>
   <line type="dialogue">did in that poor boy,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this one was a part of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank you, Mr. Polk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That Danny was a good one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lot of spunk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But heartbroken</line>
   <line type="dialogue">because the Phillies did something
with a pennant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They blew the pennant race in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That boy was thrown off of
the baseball team.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he was always trying</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to organize a game at the bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was going to be</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a cheerleader.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I get the vapors just thinking about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whoa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You, uh, Timmy O'Brien?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's it about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just, uh, following up a dog call</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from a long time ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You recognize this individual?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ever get on her case?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Word is, you took care of business</line>
   <line type="dialogue">with the local drag queens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't ask them to come to
my neighborhood,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">start parading around on the streets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I never hurt nobody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm just carrying out a duty here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, uh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what did you do to these fine citizens?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kid stuff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, harassing them, like.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Throwing stuff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bottles, sticks?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chinese takeout.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's that work?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, when we had some leftovers,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">see a couple of f*gs on our street,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we'd dump the food on them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">as*ault with a deadly egg roll?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you ever see this kid?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause he was a local f*g.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't recognize him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't proud of all that stuff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't want my kids to know I did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was just pranks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have a good day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your Honor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for letting me know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I wanted to meet her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The hotel said she was brought here
last night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm. How's she doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have you gone in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I was nervous.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A grown man, and I'm scared to meet his mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So I'll go with you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Helen, this is Hank.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're the boy who ran out of the room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hank.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any progress?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We've got at least</line>
   <line type="dialogue">one person of interest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Local thug in the neighborhood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Told a story about throwing
Chinese leftovers</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at gay men out on the street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You talked to that man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanted to know about Danny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In many ways, Danny was a man of his time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He lied about his life to some people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In other ways,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny was ahead of his time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He didn't hate himself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Somehow, he knew</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he had a right to exist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You haven't told them, have you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My parents? You crazy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No way, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If they even suspected I was rooting</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for the Phillies against the Braves,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd be dead to them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could never go home again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, guys... ladies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's it goin'?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's a little Chinese for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear f*ggots like Chinese food.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I wanna see their faces.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Officer...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Danny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Officer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny was brave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wasn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What happened</line>
   <line type="dialogue">after the Chinese food?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went home, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny came over later,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and we fought.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He stormed out...
obviously went to the Hush Room,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and... and I never saw him again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know the name of the officer
he spoke to?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have the paperwork.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danny threw it at me that night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">called me a coward.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You kept it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything I had of his, I kept.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You loved him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm glad.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">from a Daniel Holtz in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Neighborhood boys</line>

   <line type="dialogue">I knew this day would come.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's meet tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That kid Danny had moxie,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">coming to me with the noodles droppin'
from his forehead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I asked him if he was the shortstop</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on the Penn baseball team,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">'cause I recognize him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went to some of them games.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You talked about baseball
at a time like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was embarrassed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Embarrassed because he was a f*g</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you had to talk to him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the whole situation was embarrassing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How old were you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Twenty-two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just started on the job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought, I'm set.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Next thing you know,
I'm John Russo's bagman.</line>
