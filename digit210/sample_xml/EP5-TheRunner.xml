   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Standard cassette player and recorder
way old school. Early ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I transferred the audio
from analog to digital.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The stuff after the g*nshots,
the man's muttering,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm still working on that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But check this out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shan...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm going to eq it by rolling off
some of the top and bottom,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">filter out the background noise.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tweak it and clean it, correct the pitch.
Bam!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like some sort of public
announcement system. / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And near a railroad station.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sh... shanning station.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The old train tracks in north Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They closed that station some time
in the...early ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lover's lane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know this from experience?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not a soul around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just you and the stars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lonely place to die.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Small caliber w*apon fired three times
in the vicinity of shanning station.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Before it closed in ' .
That narrows it down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where the hell is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you say shanning station?
- Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not gonna find that
box job down here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This one was one of our own.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never left homicide,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three sh*ts to the heart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One year on the force.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washington? / Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He just graduated from the academy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Worked in the th district.
Citywide Manhunt For Cop k*ller</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Raised in a North Carolina orphanage,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a stint in the military before
entering the police academy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washington was responding
to a domestic call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He never made it there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A few hours later, they found his body
near the shanning tracks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blood spatter matching</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washington's blood type was found
in a stolen vehicle</line>
   <line type="dialogue">left on a turnpike two days later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was mostly a dead end.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We lifted a fingerprint off
the car windshield. No hits.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe we run the print again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd like to work with you on this one, Lily.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew Joe Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You knew his partner?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of him.
Butch Rinaldi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why wasn't he with Washington that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I let him go out alone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shouldn't have done that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Must have pulled over a motorist that
ran a traffic light or something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe got three b*ll*ts for his trouble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was standing right here</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when I first seen Diane that night
Joe's wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Butchy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Diane lost the baby a few weeks later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You last saw Washington
at : midnight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's when our shift ended.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On the tape, there's a train horn
seconds after the g*nshots.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We checked train schedules
at the museum.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only one arrival that night at : A.M.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So we can place time of death
about an hour after you saw Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But shanning's only five minutes
from the precinct.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he wasn't headed
to the domestic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He said he was, clear as day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">According to the logs, dispatch sent
another call ten minutes after the domestic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Drug activity
at the raymond jennings project</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where the tape recorder was found.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If Washington responded to that call,
the timeline adds up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Raymond jennings wasn't
even in our district.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why would Joe go there and
not tell no one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what we got to find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did live in the raymond jennings project,
young lady.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I called the police that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My tax pays your salary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a call you made, Ms. Gloria.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember real good, sir.
You want to know why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because those damn police
actually came for once.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What does that mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Black folks from the project calling
on Friday night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">police don't come.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But that night that
black cop showed up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he gets to fighting
with the drug dealer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What drug dealer?
- Never saw him before,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but after I called the police,
I went out to see what happened,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not expecting a damn thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get off my court.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't own this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I own this. I own you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I own everything you is, Joe boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't better than me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You just pretend you is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The dealer called him Joe?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe this, Joe that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That black cop must have come
around the projects regular</line>
   <line type="dialogue">cause he knew enough not
to park at the curb.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those drug dealers'll see him
a-coming a mile away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd the drug dealer look like?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Skinny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Young.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Black.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Strutting around like
some sort of crazy rooster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My eyes been bad since forever.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't tell you more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I did hear those druggies
calling him "the runner".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?
- The runner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kinda name is that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank you, Ms. Menards.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washington called the k*ller
that on the tape, the runner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause he knew him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They both knew each other.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Real well.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did patrol of the raymond
jennings projects in the ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never heard the name the runner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy ain't in the system anywhere.
No arrests, nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how'd this runner and
Washington get so cozy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And how'd Washington know those projects
enough to know where to park</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when he didn't even work that district?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he had it in for drug dealers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washingtong's patrol log.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Radioed in calls on dealers
in his district constantly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got into two altercations.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a lot of hate here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Love hate.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No arrests on his record.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Smoke and mirrors?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Acts tough for appearances' sake,
but he's really on the take?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bank records don't show cash coming in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But cash was going out,
every few weeks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These didn't cover
his usual living expenses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wrote clearly marked
checks for those.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And these sums are
big enough to stand out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are we thinking, buying dr*gs?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, addicts clean out bank
within a couple months.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This doesn't follow that pattern.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what was he doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe his widow knows.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The runner?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never heard of him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How long were you married, Diane?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ten months, two weeks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Joe a big spender? Um...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">first year of marriage and all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. We just got the house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">these checks he wrote
for cash every few weeks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know what they were for?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He got me flowers every Friday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And movies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We went to movies all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I never thought
it would amount to that much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought things would be
different by now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That I'd be different.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Time makes things worse, not better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe time also finds the truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you tell me what you
remember from that day, Diane?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were thinking about
what to name our baby.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our little girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Marianne.
- No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Martha.
- Uh-uh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matilda.
- No way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, Mr. Man,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">let me see you come up with
something more groovy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You want groovy, baby?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh, I want far out,
psychedelic, groovy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about Diane?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm vibing Diane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love diane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Love me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what else?
- What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna love ya, love ya,
love ya just a little more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come here, baby.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe left for work minutes later...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I never saw him again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sometimes I think,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My god, she'd be a woman by now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My little girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyway...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if you think of anything else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Rush?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could you tell from the tape</line>
   <line type="dialogue">whether Joe was in pain when he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wasn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know if Diane was telling
the truth about the money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wonder why she was never asked about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe Butch has an idea.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tonight's first Thursday at the tavern right?
Bet he'll be there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not going to first Thursday.
- Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The old timers don't take too kindly to
women crashing their night with the boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Too bad. It's a new world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those dinosaurs are
bad enough sober, Lilly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You saying you won't go with me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm saying go see Butch in the morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget Jones tavern.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wife know you're on a date tonight?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Butch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know detective Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How you doing, Butch?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This one's for Joe Washington
and all the guys who died on the line.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got to talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Diane called and told me about the crap
you came asking about Joe's money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was money going
out of his account.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what it was for?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This ain't no place to bring a lady, bro.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any ideas about the money, Butch?
- No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Turns out Washington knew
runner real well.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hope no one's trying to associate
my fallen partner with some drug dealer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd he know runner, Butch?
- She thinks she can come in here...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just answer the question.
- Smearing a good cop's name...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm the one asking the questions.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what's your question, detective?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Washington paying someone off?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know who we got here, boys?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The only female in homicide
working cold cases.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Know why?
- Maybe you ought to sit down, Butch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause it's in the basement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where the little lady can
dust down the files.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how'd it go at the tavern?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a*s handed to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Does that surprise you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think Sarreti, the assigned on the case,
suspected the drug angle, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An interview Sarreti did
with Deante Rollins, heroin dealer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His territory was raymond jennings
in the early ' 's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like Sarreti was wondering
about the cash himself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But we can't ask him 'cause he keeled
over from a heart attack last year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And back then,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Deante wasn't sharing.
- What about now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he's learned to play with others.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never heard of no runner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You sure about that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I say, never heard of him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And your word is bond, Deante.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My name is Brother Jamal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure it is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Asalaam a fakim, my brother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like you know what that means.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What does it mean, Jamal?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Peace be with you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have you found it yet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Peace?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a journey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There is no it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There is no end.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A tough road, redemption.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, especially when you're dealing
smack to women and children.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never sold to children. Ever.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Back in the day, we was businessmen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Organized, chains of command,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">none of this teenage gangsta bull today.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were disciplined.
- That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Working those basketball courts,
-seven, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never missed a day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you were there that night
Washington got k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you must have seen the fight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. I seen it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't own this, man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I own this. I own you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I own everything you is, Joe boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the cop runs up into the projects.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was he doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A few minutes later
he comes running back down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sam!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sam!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where'd Sammy go to?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about runner?
You seen him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where did runner go, huh?!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Took off in some car, man!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Towards the tracks, man!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's Sammy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The reason runner and his homie split
'cause of something that happened to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who was his homie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All I know is they was tight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had the same tattoo on their knuckles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here we go.
Joseph Washingtongs autopsy photo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From the original negative,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I printed onto technical pan film
and transferred onto high contrast slides.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From what you asked, I figured
density slicing might do the trick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's when you take each scale of gray
and you print it as pure black and white.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that the best you can do, Ray?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matter of fact, I did better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that's how Washington
knew the runner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washington hung with a small-time</line>
   <line type="dialogue">heroin dealer called the runner
in the early ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We checked juvie records
in the court history database.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Used the tattoo as an identifying mark.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Meet the real Joe Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">years old, arrested for selling smack.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gave the arresting officer a false name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why police background
check missed it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No North Carolina orphanage?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fairy tale.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He grew up in raymond jennings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Straightens out, starts flying right,
joins the military.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then the police academy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gets married, and...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we know the rest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Washington buried who
he was from everyone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even his wife?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never knew those things about him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He never told you where
he really came from?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There were other things he was
hiding from you, weren't there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone robbed you, Diane...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">of your husband, of your child.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">don't you think he should pay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everybody wanted to remember him
as this golden boy...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">great cop...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">great husband.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't want to rain on their parade.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By doing what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew he was...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he was involved with somebody else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Married less than a year
and already cheating.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What a joke.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One afternoon,
he went out to the sh**ting range,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I needed something from the store,
so I called him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wasn't there.
He never showed up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When he came home that night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I said,
"hey baby, how was target practice?"</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he said, fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'd go out two,
maybe three times a month.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One day I followed him...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her name was Sammy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes. / And she lived at
the raymond jennings projects?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you ever confront Joe about her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was years old and pregnant.
What was the point?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you never told the
assigned detective this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or even butch?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I said, what was the point?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I always wanted to
go back there one day...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">meet her face to face,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I never did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Heads up. You never know when
a  TV might fall out of a window.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Samuela?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This must be the girl who drove
Washington and runner apart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like our sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think she's still here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After all these years?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In these projects,
where you're born is where you die.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking for Samuela Robbins?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, I am she.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're miss Samuela?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes. I said that already.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Jeffries.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could we come in?
- I'd rather you not, thank you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you know a Joe Washington,
Miss Samuela?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You here about Joe?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You should have said so! Come in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe grew up on this very floor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why, he took care of Sammy
ever since they were kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My granddaughter, Samantha.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They grew up together?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like brother and sister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'd bring her back from
school every day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Real protective.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was all the love
he had in the world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you remember
when you last saw him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, after he moved out,
he used to come by all the time,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">bring her toys, take her to the fair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why, on that night he...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the night he what? / Oh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">no, I..I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The night he was k*lled.
Isn't that what you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I don't know anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe loved your granddaughter,
like his own blood, didn't he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, he did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he came here the night
he was k*lled, didn't he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, he did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He think he owns me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Owns Sammy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's wrong?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought Sammy was in her room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, she's messing with runner,
takes him them dr*gs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know that, Mrs. Samuela?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I... she won't listen to me,
and I can't keep her in the house all day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry, Miss Samuela.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know it ain't your fault.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's just the way things go around here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now it's my turn to take care of Sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know we talked about this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know she gots to get out of here</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if she's ever going to
have a chance for a life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That night Joe was k*lled,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and Sammy...
it was difficult, you understand?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No mother, no father,
just me and Joe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And then he was gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So why didn't you come forward
when Joe was m*rder*d?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was nothing
I could do to bring him back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Sammy..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where is she?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I haven't seen her in over years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The dr*gs, they kind of took her over
when Joe died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you know someone...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">called the runner?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe's best friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mason Tucker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They went to the catholic
school together, ran track.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that's why the nickname.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Long way from raymond jennings,
aren't you, Mason?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I help you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Jeffries.
Homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We just had a few questions.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About Joe Washington?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your homie from high school?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your little drug-running buddy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew Joe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your point?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Night he was m*rder*d, we got witnesses
in the projects saying you two had a fight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't remember no fight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Course not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember what you were fighting about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll say it again, I don't remember.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about Sammy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you remember her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your point being?
- The girl had a lot of problems,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and from what I hear,
you had something to do with it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whatever problems Sammy had
were Joe's doing, not mine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not what I hear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear it was all on you, Mason.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then I suggest you check
the hospital records yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was the one who brought
her in, not me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, if you don't have anything else,
I'd like to enjoy my afternoon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, uh, one last question.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How does one go from
selling smack to selling jags?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Children do dumb things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sure you did, too, detective Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That isn't who I am now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy was like
a little sister to Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He felt responsible for her,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for Mason Tucker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The night of the m*rder, Washington</line>
   <line type="dialogue">hears a radio call about drug activity
at the raymond jennings projects.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And from the description,
he knows it's mason?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He goes to the projects,
fights with mason,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">gets Sammy's grandma to okay
his plan to get her out of there,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy's gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washington hears Mason took off
for the railroad tracks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He follows.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that's where he ends up dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Mason drops off the face of the earth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only to reemerge as a law-abiding,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">yacht-owning citizen years later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Deante talked about an incident
that went down</line>
   <line type="dialogue">between mason, Sammy and
Washington years before the m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do we know what it was?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only that it put her in the hospital.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm-mm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please don't let it be that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got to look at it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The nearest emergency room
is Saint Joseph's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, the best person to
ask is Sammy herself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Check narcotic intelligence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just got the news.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got a hit on the fingerprint inside
the stolen car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The k*ller's car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The print in the car matches
Samantha Robbins.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy was in the car
when Washington got k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for the tip about the hospital.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Sammy od'd on heroin in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now how's a little girl
get her hands on that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause Washington told
the doctors you gave it to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a lie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what, Mason?
I'm like you. I lie a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's both try something new...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll tell you the truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You want know what happened to Sammy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was during high school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me and Washington were
getting high all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">hey, you're my bro, you know that man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You all I got, Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gonna own this world, you and me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I play?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get outta here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna play the game.
- I said get outta here!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't yell at the angel, bro.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy, put that down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shut up, Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ow!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that's why he went his way
and you went yours?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seems to be the way the ball bounced.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mason, I know sammy was in the car
that night Joe was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who told you that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A middle-aged heroin whore?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe was running from
his guilt about Sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you running from?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna talk to me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">talk to my lawyer...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">b*tch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cop on kensington said
Sammy's in here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Coming on the end of her days.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This her first time in detox?
- Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bet it won't be her last.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe it will be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause maybe
she's looking for forgiveness.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought Denise Funderbunk was
a pretty weird name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of the counselors here,
that's her name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For real.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for bringing in the tape recorder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your tape recorder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why you here anyway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why ain't you arresting the guy
who did it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need your help, Sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm clean outta help.
Ain't got nothing to give.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's all about you, isn't it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Always getting in trouble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Always waiting for someone
to bail you out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why Joe came
to the projects that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why he died,
helping you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Helping me?
Helping me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He lied to me!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He promised and then
he just went and died!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did Joe promise
you the night he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He promised to take me home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, get off of my car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't own this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I own this. I own you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I own everything you is, Joe boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't better than me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You just pretend you is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I told you not to mess with Mason!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told you not to touch that crap!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't do nothing!
You can't tell me what to do!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't my daddy!
- You ain't got no daddy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't got nobody.
I'm all you got.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You shut up!
You shut up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, look,
come here, come here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My wife's going to take care of you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Give you the love you don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's go up and talk to your grandma.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She won't let me go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You stay here and wait for me, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mason don't own you, Sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You own you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gonna wait for me or what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gimme so skin.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He went up and never came down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's all I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm. Really?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how'd your tape recorder
get in mason's car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And your fingerprint?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think this is over?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just 'cause you dropped
a tape recorder on my desk?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ever hear of the eighth step, Sammy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Making amends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not till you tell me
what happened on those tracks that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Big old bad Mason don't own you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You own you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think you can just walk on out
after all I done for you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta pee, runner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, he thinks he can take
what's mine and walk away?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I own you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He don't own you. I do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come here.
Come here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Runner!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When I woke up,
we weren't at the tracks any more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We was headed back to the projects.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mason was driving and talking, and...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he just kept talking to himself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was he saying?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The lord's prayer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He left me near the garbage dump
outside my building.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like a piece of trash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You never answered my question...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">about why you're running.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And why it never ends...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the running.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not talking to you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm talking to you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fact is, I'm here to arrest you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So sit down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We found Sammy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't own her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't know a thing about me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know what it's like to run</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from who you are...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what you're talking about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">...From what you did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you can't, can you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you spend your whole life running.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">you're praying.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were asking for forgiveness.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He should have never
tried to change things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He should have never come back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He... he should... he... he...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he was all the love I had in this world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Joe was looking for forgiveness.</line>
